# Agreeable subgroups of `GL₂(ℤ̂)`

Following Zywina (*Explicit open images for elliptic curves over `ℚ`*, §1.4), an open subgroup `H`
of `GL₂(ℤ̂)` is agreeable if `det(H) = ℤ̂ˣ`, `H` contains the scalar matrices, and the levels of
`H ≤ GL₂(ℤ̂)` and of `H ∩ SL₂(ℤ̂) ≤ SL₂(ℤ̂)` have the same odd prime divisors. As in
`LeanBridge.ForMathlib.LinearAlgebra.Matrix.GL2.Level`, `GL₂(ℤ̂)` is the product `∏_ℓ GL₂(ℤ_ℓ)`.

The agreeable quotient is defined as the coset space `H̃ / H`, a group as soon as `H` is normal in
its agreeable closure `H̃`. For an open `H` with `det(H) = ℤ̂ˣ`, as in Zywina's Prop. 8.1 and the
LMFDB, `H` is normal in `H̃` with the same commutator subgroup, and `H̃ / H` is finite and abelian
(`LeanBridge.ForMathlib.NumberTheory.ModularCurve.AgreeableClosure`); without that condition these
claims can fail.

## Main definitions

* `Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.adelicScalars`: the subgroup of scalar matrices of `GL₂(ℤ̂)`.
* `Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.IsAgreeable` (LMFDB `modcurve.agreeable`): agreeable subgroups.
* `Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.agreeableClosure` (LMFDB `modcurve.agreeable`): the agreeable closure.
* `Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.AgreeableQuotient` (LMFDB `modcurve.agreeable`): the agreeable
  quotient.

## Main results

* `Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.isAgreeable_top`: `GL₂(ℤ̂)` itself is agreeable.
* `Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.le_agreeableClosure`: a subgroup is contained in its agreeable closure.
