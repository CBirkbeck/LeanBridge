\subsection{Point counts of the curve}
\begin{definition}\label{av.fq.curve_point_counts}
\uses{ag.abelian_variety,ag.base_field,ag.jacobian,av.isogeny}
If an {{KNOWL('ag.abelian_variety', 'abelian variety')}} $A$ {{KNOWL('ag.base_field', 'defined')}} over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ is the {{KNOWL("ag.jacobian", "Jacobian")}} of a curve $X$, then from the data for $A$ we can produce a count of the (finite) number of points of $X$ defined over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and its extensions $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, $\mathbb{F}_{q^3}$, $\mathbb{F}_{q^4}$, etc.

Even if $A$ is not known to be {{KNOWL('av.isogeny', 'isogenous')}} to a Jacobian, we can still perform this computation. In that case, we refer to the virtual curve associated to $A$, since we do not know a priori if the curve whose points we are counting exists. In particular, if the point count returns a negative number, or if the point count returns a number for $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$ smaller than for $\mathbb{F}_{q^d}$ for some factor $d \mid n$, then we know that $A$ is not isogenous to a Jacobian.
