\begin{definition}\label{av.fq.l-polynomial}
\uses{ag.abelian_variety,ag.base_field,ag.dimension,av.fq.weil_polynomial,nf.weil_polynomial}
Let $A$ be an \hyperref[ag.abelian_variety]{abelian variety} of \hyperref[ag.dimension]{dimension} $g$ \hyperref[ag.base_field]{defined} over $\F_q$.  Let $F_q$ be the inverse of the field automorphism $x \mapsto x^q$ in $\Gal(\overline{\F}_q/\F_q)$, which acts on $\ell$-adic \'etale cohomology.  The \textbf{L-polynomial} of $A$ is
    $$L_A(t) = \det(1-t F_q|H^1(A_{\overline{\F}_q}, \Q_\ell)).$$
This is a polynomial of degree $2g$ with integer coefficients that are independent of $\ell$.  Its constant term is $1$.

The L-polynomial $L_A(t)$ is the reverse of the \hyperref[av.fq.weil_polynomial]{characteristic polynomial} $P_A(t)$, which is a \hyperref[nf.weil_polynomial]{Weil $q$-polynomial}.  Thus the complex roots of $L_A(t)$ have absolute value $q^{-1/2}$.
\end{definition}
