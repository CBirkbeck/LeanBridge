There are exactly 8 isomorphism classes of curves over finite fields with trivial class group. Of these, 7 were identified by Madan and Queen in 1972 \cite{doi:10.4064/aa-20-4-423-432, MR:0306160}; it was claimed by Leitzel, Madan, and Queen in 1975 \cite{doi:0.1016/0022-314X(75)90004-9,MR:0369326} that this list is complete. The 8th example was found by Stirpe in 2014 \cite{doi:10.1016/j.jnt.2014.02.016, MR:3227356}, and completeness of the resulting list was proved independently by Mercuri and Stirpe \cite{arxiv:1406.5365,doi:10.1016/j.jnt.2015.02.008,MR:3339577} and Shen and Shi \cite{arxiv:1412.3505,doi:10.1016/j.jnt.2015.02.005,MR:3339578}.
