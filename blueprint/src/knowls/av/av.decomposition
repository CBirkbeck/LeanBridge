\begin{definition}\label{av.decomposition}
\uses{av.simple}
Any abelian variety $A$ is isogenous to a product of \hyperref[av.simple]{simple} abelian varieties $B_i$, called the \textbf{isogeny factors} of $A$:
$$A \sim B_1 \times \cdots \times B_n.$$
We say that $A$ decomposes up to isogeny into the product of the $B_i$.
Note that two elements of this product might be isogenous; in other words, elements of the decomposition may appear with multiplicity.
\end{definition}
