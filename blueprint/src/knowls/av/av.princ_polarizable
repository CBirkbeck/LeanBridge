\begin{definition}\label{av.princ_polarizable}
\uses{ag.abelian_variety,ag.jacobian,av.polarization}
An \hyperref[ag.abelian_variety]{abelian variety} is \textbf{principally polarizable} if it admits a \hyperref[av.polarization]{polarization} that is an isomorphism. For example, the \hyperref[ag.jacobian]{Jacobian} of a curve admits a canonical principal polarization; by the Torelli theorem, the curve is uniquely determined by its Jacobian together with this polarization.

An isogeny class of abelian varieties is principally polarizable if one of its members admits a principal polarization.
