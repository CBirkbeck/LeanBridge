\subsection{Potential toric rank}
\begin{definition}\label{av.potential_toric_rank}
\uses{ag.abelian_variety,ag.potential_good_reduction,av.semiabelian_variety,nf,nf.prime}
Let $A$ be an {{KNOWL("ag.abelian_variety", "abelian variety")}} over a {{KNOWL("nf", "number field")}} $K$, and let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a {{KNOWL("nf.prime", "prime")}} of $K$. Then after a finite extension $K \subset L$, there is an integral model of $A$ whose reduction is a {{KNOWL("av.semiabelian_variety", "semiabelian variety")}}, i.e. the extension of an abelian variety by a torus. The **potential toric rank** of $A$ at $\mathfrak{p}$ is the dimension of that torus.

As a special case, $A$ has {{KNOWL("ag.potential_good_reduction", "potential good reduction")}} if and only if its potential toric rank is 0.
\end{definition}
