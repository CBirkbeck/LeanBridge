\begin{definition*}\label{av.potential_toric_rank}
\uses{ag.abelian_variety,ag.potential_good_reduction,av.semiabelian_variety,nf,nf.prime}
Let $A$ be an \hyperref[ag.abelian_variety]{abelian variety} over a \hyperref[nf]{number field} $K$, and let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a \hyperref[nf.prime]{prime} of $K$. Then after a finite extension $K \subset L$, there is an integral model of $A$ whose reduction is a \hyperref[av.semiabelian_variety]{semiabelian variety}, i.e. the extension of an abelian variety by a torus. The \textbf{potential toric rank} of $A$ at $\mathfrak{p}$ is the dimension of that torus.

As a special case, $A$ has \hyperref[ag.potential_good_reduction]{potential good reduction} if and only if its potential toric rank is 0.
