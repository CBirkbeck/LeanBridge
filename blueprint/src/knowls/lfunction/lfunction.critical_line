\begin{definition}\label{lfunction.critical_line}
\uses{lfunction,lfunction.functional_equation}
The \textbf{critical line} of an \hyperref[lfunction]{L-function}  is the line of symmetry of its \hyperref[lfunction.functional_equation]{functional equation}.

In the \hyperref[lfunction.normalization]{analytic normalization}, the functional equation relates $s$ to $1-s$ and the
critical line is the line $\Re(s) = \frac12$.

In the arithmetic normalization, the functional equation relates $s$ to $1 + w - s$,
where $w$ is the motivic weight.  In that normalization the critical line is
$\Re(s) = \frac{1+w}2$.
