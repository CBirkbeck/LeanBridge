In 1949 Hans Maass made his profound discovery that there are L-functions associated with
non-holomorphic automorphic forms. In his Math Review of
Maass' article \cite{MR0031519}
J. Lehner writes

<i>In Hecke's theory of Dirichlet series with Euler products we associate, roughly speaking,
a Dirichlet series with an automorphic function; the invariance of the latter under linear
substitutions is used, together with the Mellin transform, to derive a functional equation
for the Dirichlet series. This suffices for the discussion of the $\zeta$-function of an imaginary
quadratic field, for example, but not of a real quadratic field. In order to handle the latter case,
the author defines a class of functions
 ("automorphic wave functions") to take the place of the analytic
automorphic functions of Hecke's theory. </i>

Maass' work prompted Andr\'e; Weil to remark ``Il a fallu Maass pour nous sortir du ghetto des fonctions holomorphes.''
