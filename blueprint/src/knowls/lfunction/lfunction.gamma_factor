\subsection{Gamma factors}
\begin{definition}\label{lfunction.gamma_factor}
\uses{lfunction.euler_product}
The complex functions
\[
\Gamma_\R(s) := \pi^{-s/2}\Gamma(s/2)\qquad\text{and}\qquad \Gamma_\C(s):= 2(2\pi)^{-s}\Gamma(s)
\]
that appear in the {{KNOWL('lfunction.functional_equation', 'functional equation')}} of an L-function are known as **gamma factors**.  Here $\Gamma(s):=\int_0^\infty e^{-t}t^{s-1}dt$ is Euler's gamma function.

The gamma factors satisfy 
$
\Gamma_\C(s) = \Gamma_\R(s) \Gamma_\R(s + 1)
$
and can also be viewed as ``missing'' factors of the {{KNOWL('lfunction.euler_product', 'Euler product')}} of an L-function corresponding to (real or complex) archimedean places.
