In 1939 R. A. Rankin \cite{MR0000411} studied Ramanujan's conjecture about the size of $\tau(n)$
and was led to consider the analytic properties of $g(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \tau(n)^2 n^{-s}$.
He proved that $\zeta(2s-22) g(s)$ is analytic everywhere except for a simple
pole at $s=12$  and satisfies a functional equation. This was the beginning
of the Rankin - Selberg convolution which we now realize was a hugely important event in the theory of L-functions. Selberg \cite{MR0002626} did the same calculation
around the
same time.
