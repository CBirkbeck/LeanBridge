In 1859, in an 8 page paper ``\"Uber die Anzahl der Primzahlen unter einer
gegebenen Gr\"{o}sse'' \cite{href{http://www.claymath.org/sites/default/files/zeta.pdf}{Transcript}} read to the Berlin Academy of Sciences by Gauss' former student Encke,
 Riemann first considered $\zeta(s)$ as a function of a complex variable $s$. 
He proved that $\zeta(s)$
is a meromorphic function in the complex $s$-plane whose only singularity is a simple pole at $s=1$ with 
residue 1. He went on to prove that
$$\xi(s)=\frac{1}{2} s(s-1)\pi^{-s/2}\Gamma(s/2) \zeta(s)$$
is entire of order 1 and satisfies the functional equation
$$\xi(s)=\xi(1-s).$$
He proved that $\xi(s)$ has infinitely many zeros, all of which are in the critical strip $0\le \sigma\le 1$, where $\sigma$ denotes the real part of $s$.
Riemann calculated the first few of these zeros (this was discovered later when Siegel studied Riemann's
notes left to the G&ouml;ttingen library) and found them to lie on the critical line
$\sigma=1/2$. He conjectured that all of the zeros are on this line. 
And the analytic theory of L-functions was born!
