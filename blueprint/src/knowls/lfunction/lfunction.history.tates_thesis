In 1950 Tate's PhD thesis 
``Fourier analysis in number fields and Hecke's zeta-functions''
 reprinted in 
   Algebraic Number Theory (Proc. Instructional Conf., Brighton, 1965), 1967, 
pp. 305-347 Thompson, Washington, D.C.,
introduced a way to do harmonic analysis on adelic spaces and led
to great simplifications in the calculations of Euler factors and functional equations of 
L-functions over number fields, in particular,  and generally for 
any L-function with conductor larger than 1. This work paved the way for subsequent work
associating L-functions to automorphic forms.
