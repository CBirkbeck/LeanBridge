\begin{definition}\label{lfunction}
\uses{lfunction.dirichlet_series,lfunction.euler_product,lfunction.functional_equation}
An (analytic) \textbf{L-function} is a \hyperref[lfunction.dirichlet_series]{Dirichlet series} that has an \hyperref[lfunction.euler_product]{Euler product} and satisfies a certain type of \hyperref[lfunction.functional_equation]{functional equation}.

It is expected that all L-functions satisfy the \hyperref[lfunction.rh]{Riemann Hypothesis,} that all of the \hyperref[lfunction.zeros]{zeros} in the \hyperref[lfunction.critical_strip]{critical strip} are on the \hyperref[lfunction.critical_line]{critical line}. Selberg has defined a class $\mathcal S$ of Dirichlet series that satisfy the \hyperref[lfunction.selberg_class.axioms]{Selberg axioms.} It is conjectured (but far from proven) that $\mathcal S$ is precisely the set of all L-functions. Selberg's axioms have not been verified for all of the L-functions in this database but are known to hold for many of them.

It is also conjectured that a precise form of the \hyperref[lfunction.functional_equation]{functional equation} holds for every element of $\mathcal S$. Under this assumption the functional equation is determined by a quadruple known as the \hyperref[lfunction.selbergdata]{Selberg data}, consisting of the \hyperref[lfunction.degree]{degree}, \hyperref[lfunction.conductor]{conductor}, \hyperref[lfunction.spectral_parameters]{spectral parameters}, and \hyperref[lfunction.root_number]{sign}.
