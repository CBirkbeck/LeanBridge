\subsection{Ramanujan tau L-function}
\begin{definition}\label{lfunction.history.ramanujan_tau}
\uses{mf.1.12.1.a.top}
In 1916 Ramanujan \cite{MR2280861} made the startling observation that the coefficients of the {{KNOWL('mf.1.12.1.a.top', "$\Delta$ function")}} 
are multiplicative! Ramanujan defined $\tau(n)$ by
$$q\prod_{n=1}^\infty (1-q^n)^{24}=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \tau(n)q^n$$
and conjectured that $\tau(mn)=\tau(m)\tau(n)$ whenever $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime. 
Moreover that $$\sum_{r=0}^\infty \tau(p^r)X^r = (1-\tau(p)X +p^{11}X^2)^{-1}$$
and that $|\tau(p)|< 2p^{11/2}$. The first two of these astounding conjectures were  verified 
by Mordell in 1917 (see
``On Mr. Ramanujan's Empirical Expansions
of Modular Functions.''
Proc. Cambridge Phil. Soc.19, (1917))
 and the last by Deligne in 1974 in work for which he won a Fields
Medal. It was already known   that 
$$\Delta(z)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \tau(n)e(nz)$$
is a modular form of weight 12. Thus $L(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \tau(n)n^{-s}$ 
has  a functional equation and (by Mordell) 
an Euler product.  Ramanujan's discovery was the ushering in of a new age of arithmetic L-functions.
