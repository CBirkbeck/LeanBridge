\begin{definition}\label{lfunction.history.hecke_operators}
\uses{}
Hecke \cite{MR1513122}, building on Mordell, introduced operators acting on
vector spaces of modular forms.  The forms which were simultaneous eigenvalues
of these operators have multiplicative Fourier coefficients so that their
associated Dirichlet series have Euler products and functional equations.
Hecke mainly worked with level 1 modular forms.
The more subtle theory of Hecke operators for spaces of higher level and
with character was developed by Atkin and Lehner, and Li \cite{MR268123}.
