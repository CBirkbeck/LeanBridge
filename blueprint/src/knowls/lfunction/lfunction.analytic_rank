\subsection{Analytic rank}
\begin{definition}\label{lfunction.analytic_rank}
\uses{lfunction.central_point,lfunction}
The **analytic rank** of an {{KNOWL('lfunction', 'L-function')}} $L(s)$ is its order of vanishing at its {{KNOWL('lfunction.central_point', 'central point')}}.

When the analytic rank $r$ is positive, the value listed in the LMFDB is typically an upper bound that is believed to be tight (in the sense that there are known to be $r$ zeroes located very near to the central point).
\end{definition}
