\begin{definition}\label{lfunction.analytic_rank}
\uses{lfunction.central_point,lfunction}
The \textbf{analytic rank} of an \hyperref[lfunction]{L-function} $L(s)$ is its order of vanishing at its \hyperref[lfunction.central_point]{central point}.

When the analytic rank $r$ is positive, the value listed in the LMFDB is typically an upper bound that is believed to be tight (in the sense that there are known to be $r$ zeroes located very near to the central point).
