\subsection{Dirichlet's work on L-functions}
\begin{definition}\label{lfunction.history.dirichlet}

The first use of the letter L to denote  these functions was by Dirichlet in 1837 (see <i>Werke I</i> \cite{MR249268} pages 313-342) 
who 
used L-functions to prove that there are infinitely many primes in any (primitive) arithmetic progression.
He considered
series of the form 
$$L(s,\chi)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\chi(n)}{n^s}$$
where $\chi$ is a {{ KNOWL('character.dirichlet', '(Dirichlet) character') }}, which is the extension to the integers of a character of the 
group $(\mathbb Z/q\mathbb Z)^*$. For example the arithmetic function $\chi$ defined by 

\[\chi(n)=\begin{cases} 1 & \textrm{ if } n\equiv 1 \bmod 3\\
-1 & \textrm{ if } n\equiv 2\bmod 3\\
0 & \textrm{ if  }n\equiv 0\bmod 3\end{cases}\]

is a Dirichlet character modulo 3. The above L-function has an Euler product
$$L(s,\chi)=\prod_{p }\left(1-\frac{\chi(p)}{p^s}\right)^{-1}$$
and satisfies a functional equation that
$$\left(\frac{3}{\pi}\right)^{\frac{s}{2}}\Gamma\left(\frac{s+1}{2}\right) L(s,\chi)$$
is invariant under $s\to 1-s$. Also, note the special value
$$L(1,\chi)= \frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{3}};   $$
Dirichlet needed to know that his L-functions did not vanish at 1 and he 
used special values to prove this fact.
Dirichlet's original proof was for prime moduli; for composite moduli he required
his class number formula which was proven in 1839 - 1840 (see his _Werke I_, pp. 411-496).
