The \textbf{Riemann zeta-function} is defined by the \hyperref[lfunction.dirichlet_series]{Dirichlet series}
$$\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac 1{n^s},$$
which converges for $s=\sigma+it$ with $\sigma>1$. Euler showed that
$$\zeta(s)=\prod_p (1-p^{-s})^{-1},$$
known today as the \hyperref[lfunction.euler_product]{Euler product}, for $s$ a real number with $s>1$, a fact that connects the study of $\zeta(s)$ with the prime numbers.
 Riemann, in 1859,  was the first to consider $\zeta(s)$  as a function of a complex variable.  He proved that $\zeta(s)$ has an analytic continuation to the whole complex plane apart from a simple pole at $s=1$ with residue 1. Riemann proved a remarkable \hyperref[lfunction.functional_equation]{functional equation}. He showed that 
$$\xi(s):=\frac 12 s (s-1) \pi^{-s/2} \Gamma(s/2) \zeta(s) $$
is an entire function of order 1 which satisfies 
$$\xi(s)=\xi(1-s).$$
Riemann showed that the distribution of prime numbers depends on the location of the \hyperref[lfunction.zeros]{zeros} of the Riemann zeta-function which, by the Euler product and functional equation, are all in the \hyperref[lfunction.critical_strip]{critical strip} $0\le \sigma \le 1$. Riemann showed that the number $N(T)$ of zeros of 
$\zeta(s)$ in the critical strip with ordinates at most $T$ satisfies
 $$N(T)=\frac{T}{2\pi} \log\frac{T}{2\pi e} +O(\log T).$$ 
He calculated the first few zeros and verified that they are on the \hyperref[lfunction.critical_line]{critical line} $\sigma=1/2$ and then made his famous conjecture, today known as the \hyperref[lfunction.rh]{Riemann Hypothesis}, that all of the zeros are on the critical line. In 1896 Hadamard and de la Vallee Poussin independently proved that $\zeta(s)$ has no zeros on the boundary of the critical strip, i.e. all of the zeros are in the open strip $0< \sigma < 1$,
and in doing so proved the Prime Number Theorem, that the number of primes less than a large number $x$ is asymptotic to $\frac{x}{\log x}$. 

Today we know that the first 10 trillion zeros of $\zeta(s)$ are all on the critical line and that at least 41% of all of the complex zeros are on the critical line.
