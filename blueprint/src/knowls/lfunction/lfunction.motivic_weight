\begin{definition*}\label{lfunction.motivic_weight}
\uses{lfunction,lfunction.arithmetic,lfunction.normalization}
The \textbf{motivic weight} (or \textbf{arithmetic weight}) of an \hyperref[lfunction.arithmetic]{arithmetic} \hyperref[lfunction]{L-function} with \hyperref[lfunction.normalization]{analytic normalization} $L_{an}(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_nn^{-s}$ is the least nonnegative integer $w$ for which $a_nn^{w/2}$ is an algebraic integer for all $n\ge 1$.

If the L-function arises from a motive, then the weight of the motive has the
same parity as the motivic weight of the L-function, but the weight of the motive
could be larger.  This apparent discrepancy comes from the fact that a Tate twist
increases the weight of the motive.  This corresponds to the change of variables
$s \mapsto s + j$ in the L-function of the motive.
