\begin{definition}\label{lfunction.trivial_zero}
\uses{lfunction.arithmetic,lfunction.completed,lfunction.functional_equation,lfunction.gamma_factor,lfunction.normalization,lfunction.zeros}
The \hyperref[lfunction.zeros]{zeros} of an L-function $L(s)$ that occur at
poles of its  \hyperref[lfunction.gamma_factor]{gamma factors} are \textbf{trivial zeros}.

The presence of trivial zeros is required by the \hyperref[lfunction.functional_equation]{functional equation}.  In its \hyperref[lfunction.normalization]{analytic normalization}, the L-function $L(s)$ has no zeros or poles in the right half-plane $\Re(s)>1$, but the \hyperref[lfunction.gamma_factor]{gamma factors} that appear in the functional equation have poles.  Since the \hyperref[lfunction.completed]{completed L-function} has no poles (except possibly from Riemann zeta-function factors),
the L-function must have zeros at poles of the gamma factors.

For \hyperref[lfunction.arithmetic]{arithmetic} L-functions, the poles are at certain negative integers.
\end{definition}
