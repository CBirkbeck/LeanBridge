\begin{definition}\label{lfunction.sign}
\uses{lfunction.functional_equation}
The \textbf{sign} of the functional equation of an analytic L-function, also called the \textbf{root number}, is the complex number $\varepsilon$ that appears in the \hyperref[lfunction.functional_equation]{functional equation} of $\Lambda(s)=\varepsilon \overline{\Lambda}(1-s)$.  The sign appears as the 4th entry in the quadruple
known as the \hyperref[lfunction.selbergdata]{Selberg data.}
