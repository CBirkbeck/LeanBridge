\subsection{Sign of the functional equation}
\begin{definition}\label{lfunction.sign}
\uses{lfunction.functional_equation,lfunction.selbergdata}
The **sign** of the functional equation of an analytic L-function, also called the **root number**, is the complex number $\varepsilon$ that appears in the {{KNOWL('lfunction.functional_equation', "functional equation")}} of $\Lambda(s)=\varepsilon \overline{\Lambda}(1-s)$.  The sign appears as the 4th entry in the quadruple
known as the {{KNOWL('lfunction.selbergdata', "Selberg data.")}} 
\end{definition}
