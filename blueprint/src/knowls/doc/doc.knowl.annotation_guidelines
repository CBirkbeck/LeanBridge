\subsection{\href{https://beta.lmfdb.org/knowledge/show/doc.knowl.annotation_guidelines}{Guidelines for writing annotations}}
\begin{definition}\label{doc.knowl.annotation_guidelines}
\uses{doc.knowl,doc.knowl.description,doc.knowl.guidelines}
Annotations are text that is included at the top or bottom of an object's homepage. They are functionally similar to \hyperref[doc.knowl]{knowls}, but are not required to be context-free; aside from that, the \hyperref[doc.knowl.guidelines]{editing guidelines for knowls} apply also to annotations.

In addition, please observe the following conventions.

\begin{itemize}
\item  Top annotations should be one sentence, with no headings, preferably short enough to fit on one line. A typical top annotation will identify common nomenclature for an object ("This integral lattice is the Leech lattice.") or a distinguishing characteristic ("This is the elliptic curve of smallest conductor of rank 3."). When available, include an external reference (e.g., a Wikipedia page).
\item  Bottom annotations can be of arbitrary length, and may include subheadings. A typical bottom annotation will provide freeform discussion of important mathematical properties of a given object (e.g. "This is an example of an object with property XYZ.").
\item  Do not include anything in an annotation that could be put in a knowl instead (e.g., definitions of terms). Instead, create a separate knowl and link to it. If the definition falls outside the scope of LMFDB (e.g., bitcoin), use an external link to Wikipedia or some other source.
\item  Use the \hyperref[doc.knowl.guidelines]{\cite command} to cite relevant literature.
\item  It is not necessary to fill in the \hyperref[doc.knowl.description]{description} field for an annotation. When in doubt, leave it blank.
\item  Do not link directly to annotations, but instead to the underlying LMFDB objects.
\end{itemize}
