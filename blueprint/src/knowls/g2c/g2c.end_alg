\begin{definition*}\label{g2c.end_alg}
\uses{ag.abelian_surface,ag.abelian_variety,ag.endomorphism_algebra,ag.simple,av.isogeny,ec,ring.field}
The \textbf{endomorphism algebra} of an \hyperref[ag.abelian_surface]{abelian surface} $A$ over a \hyperref[ring.field]{field} $K$ is the $\Q$-algebra $\End(A) \otimes \Q$.  This is a special case of the \hyperref[ag.endomorphism_algebra]{endomorphism algebra} of an \hyperref[ag.abelian_variety]{abelian variety}.

When $A$ is an abelian surface over $\Q$, there are five possibilities for $\End(A)\otimes\Q$:

1. $\Q$;
2. a real quadratic field (in which case $A$ has \textbf{real multiplication}, denoted RM);
3. an imaginary quadratic field (in which case $A$ has \textbf{complex multiplication}, denoted CM);
4. $\Q\times \Q$;
5. $\mathrm{M}_2(\Q)$;

The first three cases occur when $A$ is \hyperref[ag.simple]{simple}, while the last two cases occur when $A$ is \hyperref[av.isogeny]{isogenous} to a product of \hyperref[ec]{elliptic curves} $E_1\times E_2$ over $\overline K$. Which of the last two cases occurs depends on whether $E_1$ and/or $E_2$ are isogenous or not.
