\subsection{Tame reduction}
\begin{definition}\label{g2c.tame_reduction}
\uses{g2c.semistable_reduction,lf.tame_degree}
The semistable reduction theorem asserts that any curve $C$ attains {{ KNOWL('g2c.semistable_reduction' , 'semistable reduction') }} after a finite extension of the base field.
If semistable reduction, can be attained after a {{ KNOWL('lf.tame_degree', 'tame extension') }} of the base field, then $C$ is said to have _tame reduction_, otherwise $C$ has _wild reduction_.
For primes $p > 2g + 1$, any curve of genus $g$ has tame reduction at $p$.
\end{definition}
