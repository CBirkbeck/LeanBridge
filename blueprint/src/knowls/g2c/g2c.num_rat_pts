\subsection{Number of rational points}
\begin{definition}\label{g2c.num_rat_pts}
\uses{ag.curve.genus,g2c.all_rational_points,g2c.known_rational_points,nf}
By a celebrated theorem of Faltings, the number of rational points on a curve of {{KNOWL('ag.curve.genus', 'genus')}} $g\ge 2$ defined over a {{KNOWL('nf', 'number field')}} is finite.  Faltings' theorem is unfortunately ineffective, and computing this finite set is a difficult problem, in general.

For curves of genus $g\ge 2$ in the LMFDB, we store all {{KNOWL('g2c.known_rational_points', 'known rational points')}}, and we indicate cases where this is provably {{KNOWL('g2c.all_rational_points', 'all rational points')}}.
\end{definition}
