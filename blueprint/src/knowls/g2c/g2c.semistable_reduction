A curve $C$ over a local field $K$ is said to have \textit{semistable reduction} if there exists a model over $\mathcal{O}_K$, such that the special fibre is semistable, i.e., the special fibre is a geometrically reduced curve with at most nodal singularities, and each component of geometric genus 0 has at least 2 singular points, counted with multiplicity.
This is the equivalent of \hyperref[ec.semistable]{semistable reduction for elliptic curves}.
