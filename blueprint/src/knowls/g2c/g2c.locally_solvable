\begin{definition}\label{g2c.locally_solvable}
\uses{ag.curve,ag.curve.genus,ag.irreducible,ag.singular_point,lf.qp,nf}
A \hyperref[ag.curve]{curve} defined over the rational numbers is said to be \textbf{locally solvable} if the equation(s) defining the curve have a solution over $\R$ and over \hyperref[lf.qp]{$\Q_p$} for every prime $p$.  For curves over \hyperref[nf]{number fields} we require solutions over every completion of the number field.

If the curve is \hyperref[ag.singular_point]{non-singular} (or even merely \hyperref[ag.irreducible]{geometrically irreducible}), then there are always at most finitely many primes $p$ such that the curve has no point over \hyperref[lf.qp]{$\Q_p$}.

Curves with a rational point are obviously always locally solvable, but the converse need not hold (unless the curve has \hyperref[ag.curve.genus]{genus} zero).  For example, the genus 1 curve $3x^3+4y^3+5z^3=0$ over $\Q$ is locally solvable but has no rational points (this example is due to Selmer).
