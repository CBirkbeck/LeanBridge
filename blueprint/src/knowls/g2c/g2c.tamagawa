\begin{definition}\label{g2c.tamagawa}
\uses{ag.abelian_variety,ag.base_change,ag.jacobian,g2c.good_reduction,lf.padic_field}
For an \hyperref[ag.abelian_variety]{abelian variety} $A$ over a \hyperref[lf.padic_field]{$p$-adic field}, the \textbf{Tamagawa number} of $A$ is the number of connected components of its N\'eron model.

For a smooth projective curve $X/\Q$ the Tamagawa number of $X$ at at a prime $p$ is the Tamagawa number of the \hyperref[ag.base_change]{base change} of its \hyperref[ag.jacobian]{Jacobian} to the field $\Q_p$.

It is a positive integer that is equal to 1 at all primes of \hyperref[g2c.good_reduction]{good reduction} for the Jacobian; it may also be 1 at primes of bad reduction.

The product of the Tamagawa numbers over all primes is a positive integer known as the \textbf{Tamagawa product}.
