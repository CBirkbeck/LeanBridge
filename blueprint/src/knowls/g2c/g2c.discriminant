\begin{definition}\label{g2c.discriminant}
\uses{}
The discriminant $\Delta$ of a Weierstrass equation $y^2+h(x)y=f(x)$ can be computed as
$$
\Delta := \begin{cases}
2^8\text{lc}(f)^2\text{disc}(f+h^2/4)&\text{if }f+h^2/4\text{ has odd degree},\\
2^8\text{disc}(f+h^2/4)&\text{if }f+h^2/4\text{ has even degree},
\end{cases}
$$
where $\text{lc}(f)$ denotes the leading coefficient of $f$ and $\text{disc}(f)$ its discriminant.
 
The \textbf{discriminant} of a genus 2 curve over $\Q$ is the discriminant of a \hyperref[g2c.minimal_equation]{minimal equation} for the curve; it is an invariant of the curve that does not depend on the choice of minimal equation.
