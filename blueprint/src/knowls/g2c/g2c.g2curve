\begin{definition}\label{g2c.g2curve}
\uses{ag.hyperelliptic_curve,g2c.discriminant,g2c.minimal_equation}
Every (smooth, projective, geometrically integral) curve of genus 2 can be defined by a \textbf{Weierstrass equation} of the form $$y^2+h(x)y=f(x)$$
with nonzero \hyperref[g2c.discriminant]{discriminant} and $\deg h \le 3$ and $\deg f \le 6$; in order to have genus 2 we must have $\deg h = 3$ or $\deg f =5,6$.  Over a field whose characteristic is not 2 one can complete the square to make $h(x)$ zero, but this will yield a model with bad reduction at 2 that is typically not a \hyperref[g2c.minimal_equation]{minimal equation} for the curve.

This equation can be viewed as defining the function field of the curve, or as a smooth model of the curve in the weighted projective plane. Every curve of genus 2 admits a degree 2 cover of the projective line (consider the function $x$) and is therefore a \hyperref[ag.hyperelliptic_curve]{hyperelliptic curve}.
