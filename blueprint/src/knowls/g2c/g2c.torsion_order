\subsection{Torsion order}
\begin{definition}\label{g2c.torsion_order}
\uses{ag.jacobian,g2c.torsion,nf}
The **torsion order** of a finitely-generated abelian group such as the Mordell-Weil group of the {{ KNOWL('ag.jacobian', 'Jacobian') }} of a curve over a {{ KNOWL('nf', 'number field') }} is the cardinality of its {{KNOWL('g2c.torsion', 'torsion subgroup')}}. The **torsion primes** are the primes that divide the torsion order, equivalently, the primes $\ell$ for which the Jacobian has a rational point of order $\ell$.
\end{definition}
