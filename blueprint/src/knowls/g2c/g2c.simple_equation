\begin{definition*}\label{g2c.simple_equation}
\uses{ag.hyperelliptic_curve,ag.jacobian,ag.mordell_weil,g2c.minimal_equation}
A \hyperref[ag.hyperelliptic_curve]{hyperelliptic curve} over $\Q$ with a \hyperref[g2c.minimal_equation]{minimal equation} of the form
\[
y^2 + h(x)y = f(x),
\]
with $h,f\in \Z[x]$ can always be defined by a \textbf{simplified equation} of the form
\[
y^2 = g(x),
\]
with $g\in \Z[x]$ defined by $g:=4f+h^2$.

In the LMFDB, invariants of hyperelliptic curves such as rational points and generators of the \hyperref[ag.mordell_weil]{Mordell-Weil group} of its \hyperref[ag.jacobian]{Jacobian} are always expressed in terms of the minimal equation, not the corresponding simplified equation (except in cases where the minimal equation has $h=0$ and the two coincide).
