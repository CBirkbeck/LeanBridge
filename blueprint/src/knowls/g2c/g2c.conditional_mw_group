\subsection{Conditional Mordell-Weil group}
\begin{definition}\label{g2c.conditional_mw_group}
\uses{ag.abelian_variety,ag.mordell_weil,g2c.analytic_rank,g2c.mordell_weil_rank,g2c.torsion}
Under the (weak) BSD conjecture, the {{KNOWL('g2c.mordell_weil_rank', 'Mordell-Weil rank')}} of an {{KNOWL('ag.abelian_variety', 'abelian variety')}} $A$ over $\Q$ is equal to its {{KNOWL('g2c.analytic_rank', 'analytic rank')}}.  If the {{ KNOWL('g2c.torsion', 'torsion subgroup') }} of $A$ and its analytic rank are known (or if one simply assumes a known upper bound on the analytic rank is tight), then the {{KNOWL('ag.mordell_weil', 'Mordell-Weil group')}} of $A$ is conditionally determined up to isomorphism,

In cases were one knows a lower bound on the Mordell-Weil group that is one less than a known upper bound on its analytic rank, it is only necessary to assume the parity conjecture.
