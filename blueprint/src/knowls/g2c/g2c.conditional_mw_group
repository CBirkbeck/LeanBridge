\begin{definition}\label{g2c.conditional_mw_group}
\uses{ag.abelian_variety,ag.mordell_weil,g2c.analytic_rank,g2c.mordell_weil_rank,g2c.torsion}
Under the (weak) BSD conjecture, the \hyperref[g2c.mordell_weil_rank]{Mordell-Weil rank} of an \hyperref[ag.abelian_variety]{abelian variety} $A$ over $\Q$ is equal to its \hyperref[g2c.analytic_rank]{analytic rank}.  If the \hyperref[g2c.torsion]{torsion subgroup} of $A$ and its analytic rank are known (or if one simply assumes a known upper bound on the analytic rank is tight), then the \hyperref[ag.mordell_weil]{Mordell-Weil group} of $A$ is conditionally determined up to isomorphism,

In cases were one knows a lower bound on the Mordell-Weil group that is one less than a known upper bound on its analytic rank, it is only necessary to assume the parity conjecture.
\end{definition}
