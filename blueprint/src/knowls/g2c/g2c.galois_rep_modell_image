\begin{definition}\label{g2c.galois_rep_modell_image}
\uses{g2c.g2curve,g2c.galois_rep}
Let $\ell$ be a prime and let $C$ be an \hyperref[g2c.g2curve]{genus 2 curve}  over a number field $K$ with Jacobian $A$.

Subgroups $G$ of $\GSp(4,\F_{\ell})$ that can arise as the image of the mod-$\ell$ \hyperref[g2c.galois_rep]{Galois representation}
\[
\bar\rho_{A,\ell}\colon {\Gal}(\overline{K}/K)\to \GSp(4,\F_{\ell})
\] 
attached to $A$ that do not contain $\Sp(4,\F_{\ell})$ are identified up to conjugacy using labels of the form 
\[
\texttt{L.i.n},
\]
where $\texttt{L}$ is the prime $\ell$, $\texttt{i}$ is the index of $G$ in $\GSp(4,\F_{\ell})$, and $\texttt{n}$ is a positive integer that distinguishes subgroups of $\GSp(4,\F_{\ell})$ of the same index.  Clicking on such a label will provide more details about $G$, including generators that can be used to construct it.
