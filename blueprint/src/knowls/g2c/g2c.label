\subsection{\href{https://beta.lmfdb.org/knowledge/show/g2c.label}{Label of a genus 2 curve over $\Q$}}
\begin{definition}\label{g2c.label}
\uses{ag.conductor,g2c.abs_discriminant,g2c.g2curve,g2c.jacobian}
The label of a \hyperref[g2c.g2curve]{genus 2 curve} over $\Q$ has the form $N$.$s$.$D$.$n$, where

\begin{itemize}
\item  $N$ is the \hyperref[ag.conductor]{conductor},
\item  $s$ is a string of letters that distinguishes this isogeny class among those with the same conductor,
\item  $D$ is the \hyperref[g2c.abs_discriminant]{absolute discriminant}, and
\item  $n$ is a positive integer that distinguishes the curve among other curves with the same absolute discriminant in the same isogeny class.
\end{itemize}

In particular, $N.s$ is the label of the isogeny class of the \hyperref[g2c.jacobian]{Jacobian} of the curve. The values $s$ and $n$ are assigned as curves are added to the database and carry no intrinsic meaning
\end{definition}
