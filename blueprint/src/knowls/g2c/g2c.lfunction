\begin{definition}\label{g2c.lfunction}
\uses{ag.abelian_variety,ag.jacobian,g2c.bad_lfactors,g2c.good_reduction,g2c.isogeny_class,lfunction.euler_product}
The \textbf{L-function} of an \hyperref[ag.abelian_variety]{Abelian variety} $A$ over $\Q$ is defined as an \hyperref[lfunction.euler_product]{Euler product} $\prod_p L_p(p^{-s})$ over primes $p$, where the \textbf{L-polynomial} $L_p(T)$ is an integer polynomial of degree at most $2g$, where $g$ is the dimension of $A$; the L-function of a curve is then defined as the L-function of its \hyperref[ag.jacobian]{Jacobian}.  The $L$-function is an invariant of the \hyperref[g2c.isogeny_class]{isogeny class} of $A$.


For primes $p$ where $A$ has \hyperref[g2c.good_reduction]{good reduction} (all but finitely many), the polynomial $L_p(T)=T^{2g}\chi(T^{-1})$ is determined by the characteristic polynomial $\chi(T)$ of the Frobenius endomomrphism of the reduction of $A$ modulo $p$.

The \hyperref[g2c.bad_lfactors]{Euler factors at bad primes} $p$ depend on the type of bad reduction $A$ has at $p$.
