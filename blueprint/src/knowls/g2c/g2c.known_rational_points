\begin{definition}\label{g2c.known_rational_points}
\uses{g2c.minimal_equation,nf}
For a curve $X$ of genus $g\ge 2$ over $\Q$ (or any \hyperref[nf]{number field}) the set of rational points $X(\Q)$ is finite, by a theorem of Faltings. At present no algorithm is known that explicitly computes a provably complete list of the points in $X(\Q)$, but one can conduct a search among points of bounded height to obtain a list of \textbf{known rational points}.

Rational points on hyperelliptic curves are written in projective coordinates with respect to the weighted homogeneous equation $y^2+h(x,z)y=f(x,z)$ of degree $2g+2$ that is a smooth projective model for the curve $X$, where $y$ has weight $g+1$, while $x$ and $z$ both have weight 1.  This homogeneous equation is uniquely determined by the affine equation $y^2+h(x)y=f(x)$ listed as the \hyperref[g2c.minimal_equation]{minimal equation} for the curve.
