\leanok
For an \hyperref[ag.abelian_variety]{abelian variety} $A$ over $\Q$, the local factor that appears in the Euler product of its L-function at a \hyperref[ag.good_reduction]{bad prime} $p$ depends on the type of reduction $A$ has at $p$.  In general, the degree of the Euler factor at a bad prime will be less than the degree of the L-function (which is $2g$, where $g$ is the dimension of the abelian variety).
