\begin{definition*}\label{g2c.two_torsion_field}
\uses{ag.abelian_variety,ag.hyperelliptic_curve,ag.mordell_weil,g2c.jacobian}
The \textbf{2-torsion field} of an \hyperref[ag.abelian_variety]{abelian variety} is the minimal field extension over which the 2-torsion subgroup of its \hyperref[ag.mordell_weil]{Mordell-Weil group} is rational; it is a Galois extension of the field over which the abelian variety is defined.

The 2-torsion field of the \hyperref[g2c.jacobian]{Jacobian} of a \hyperref[ag.hyperelliptic_curve]{hyperelliptic curve} of the form $y^2=f(x)$ is the same as the splitting field of the polynomial $f(x)$.

For abelian varieties over number fields, the 2-torsion field is specified by giving a number field of minimal degree and absolute discriminant whose Galois closure is equal to the 2-torsion field.
