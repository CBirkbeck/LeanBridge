\subsection{Torsion group}
\begin{definition}\label{group.torsion}
\uses{group,group.abelian}
A **torsion {{KNOWL('group', 'group')}}** is a group in which every element has finite order.

The elements of finite order in an {{KNOWL('group.abelian', 'abelian')}} group $A$ form a torsion group called the **torsion subgroup** of $A$.
