\begin{definition}\label{st_group.trace_zero_density}
\uses{group.haar_measure,st_group.definition}
The \textbf{trace zero density} of a \hyperref[st_group.definition]{Sato-Tate group} is the probability that a randomly sampled element (chosen according to the \hyperref[group.haar_measure]{Haar measure}) has trace zero.

On each component of a Sato-Tate group, the trace is either constant and equal to zero, or varies continuously taking each particular value with probability zero; so this probability is simply the ratio of the number of components on which the trace is identically zero to the total number of components.

\end{definition}
