\begin{definition}\label{st_group.probabilities}
\uses{group.haar_measure,st_group.definition}
If $a_i:=a_i(g)$ denotes the $i$th coefficient of the characteristic polynomial $\sum a_ix^i$ of a random matrix $g$ in a \hyperref[st_group.definition]{Sato-Tate group} $G$ with \hyperref[group.haar_measure]{Haar measure} $\mu$, then
\[
\mathrm{Pr}[a_i=n] := \mu(\{g\in G|a_i(g)=n\})
\]
can be viewed as the \textbf{probability} that a random $g\in G$ satisfies $a_i(g)=n$. This is a rational number equal to the proportion of connected components of G on which $a_i$ is identically equal to $n$, by Proposition 8.4.3.3 of Serre's *Lecture's on $N_X(p)$* \cite{doi:10.1201/b11315}.  This probability is necessarily zero unless $n$ is one of a finite set of integers.

Note that while $\mathrm{Pr}[a_i=n]=0$ implies that $\{g\in G:a_i(g) = n\}$ has measure zero, this set need not be empty (unless $G$ is finite).
