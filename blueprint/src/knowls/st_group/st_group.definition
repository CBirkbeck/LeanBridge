The \textbf{Sato-Tate group} of a motive $X$ is a compact Lie group $G$ containing (as a dense subset) the image of a representation that maps Frobenius elements to conjugacy classes.  When $X$ is an Artin motive, $G$ corresponds to the image of the \hyperref[artin]{Artin representation}; when $X$ is an \hyperref[ag.abelian_variety]{abelian variety} over a number field, one can define $G$ in terms of an $\ell$-adic Galois representation attached to $X$.

For motives of even \hyperref[st_group.weight]{weight} $w$ and \hyperref[st_group.degree]{degree} $d$, the Sato-Tate group is a compact subgroup of the orthogonal group $\mathrm{O}(d)$.  For motives of odd weight $w$ and even degree $d$, the Sato-Tate group is a compact subgroup of the \hyperref[st_group.usp]{unitary symplectic group} $\mathrm{USp}(d)$.  For motives $X$ arising as \hyperref[ag.abelian_variety]{abelian varieties}, the weight is always $w=1$ and the the degree is $d=2g$, where $g$ is the \hyperref[ag.dimension]{dimension} of the variety.

The simplest case is when $X$ is an \hyperref[ec]{elliptic curve} $E/\Q$, in which case $G$ is either $\mathrm{SU}(2)=\mathrm{USp}(2)$ (the generic case), or $G$ is $N(\mathrm{U}(1))$, the normalizer of the subgroup $\mathrm{U}(1)$ of diagonal matrices in $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, which contains $\mathrm{U}(1)$ with index 2.

The generalized Sato-Tate conjecture states that when ordered by norm, the sequence of images of Frobenius elements under this representation is equidistributed with respect to the pushforward of the \hyperref[group.haar_measure]{Haar measure} of $G$ onto its set of conjugacy classes. 
This is known for all elliptic curves over \hyperref[nf.totally_real]{totally real} number fields (including $\mathbb{Q}$) or \hyperref[nf.cm_field]{CM fields}.
