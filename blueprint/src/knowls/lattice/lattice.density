\begin{definition*}\label{lattice.density}
\uses{lattice.definition,lattice.dimension}
The \textbf{density} of an $n\times n$ \hyperref[lattice.definition]{integral lattice} is  the density of the lattice-centered sphere packing in $\mathbb R^n$. 

The \textbf{lattice packing problem} of \hyperref[lattice.dimension]{dimension} $n$ is to find the lattices which maximize the density. In general, these may not be solutions of the \textbf{sphere packing problem}, which asks for the maximum density of a sphere packing in which the centers of the spheres need not form an integral lattice.
