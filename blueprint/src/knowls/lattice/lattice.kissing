\subsection{Kissing number }
\begin{definition}\label{lattice.kissing}
\uses{lattice.dimension,lattice.minimal_vector}
The **kissing number** of a lattice, $L$, is the number of vectors of {{ KNOWL('lattice.minimal_vector',  'minimal length') }}.  The vectors in the list of {{ KNOWL('lattice.minimal_vector',  'minimal length') }} vectors are normalized, so the kissing number will always be twice as large as the number of vectors in this list. 

The **lattice kissing number problem** in {{ KNOWL('lattice.dimension','dimension') }} $n$ is to find the lattices of dimension $n$ which maximize the kissing number. In general, these may not be solutions of the **general kissing number problem**, which asks for the maximum number of spheres with non-overlapping interiors in dimension $n$ which are all tangent to a single sphere.
\end{definition}
