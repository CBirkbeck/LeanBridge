\begin{definition}\label{lattice.kissing}
\uses{lattice.dimension,lattice.minimal_vector}
The \textbf{kissing number} of a lattice, $L$, is the number of vectors of \hyperref[lattice.minimal_vector]{minimal length}.  The vectors in the list of \hyperref[lattice.minimal_vector]{minimal length} vectors are normalized, so the kissing number will always be twice as large as the number of vectors in this list. 

The \textbf{lattice kissing number problem} in \hyperref[lattice.dimension]{dimension} $n$ is to find the lattices of dimension $n$ which maximize the kissing number. In general, these may not be solutions of the \textbf{general kissing number problem}, which asks for the maximum number of spheres with non-overlapping interiors in dimension $n$ which are all tangent to a single sphere.
