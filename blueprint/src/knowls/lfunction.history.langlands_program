Langlands theory of automorphic forms ushered in an age of a new understanding
of the profundity of L-functions. His small book _Euler Products_ of 1967 contains
the beginnings of a general theory.

In 1969 Ogg \cite{MR0246819} proved the holomorphy and functional equation for the Rankin-Selberg convolution
of two inequivalent cusp forms of the same level. This is a degree 4 L-function. 
In 1972 Jacquet \cite{MR0562503} considered the Rankin-Selberg convolution 
of two GL(2) 
cusp forms and obtained the analytic continuation and functional equation of the associated L-function. 
In 1979 Winnie Li \cite{MR0550843} completed the Rankin-Selberg story for two arbitrary GL(2)
 cusp forms. Her techniques really require the use
of Tate's thesis and the theory of automorphic forms as it is virtually impossible
to figure out the Euler factors at bad primes without these. 

In 1971 Andrianov \cite{MR0340178} explicitly constructed the L-function for a genus 2 Siegel modular form
and gave its analytic continuation and functional equation.

In 1972 Godement and Jacquet \cite{MR0342495} defined the L-function of a general automorphic form
on a reductive group and obtained the analytic continuation and functional equation. 

It wasn't until the mid 1970's  that Shimura \cite{MR0382176} and, shortly later
but independently, Zagier \cite{MR0485703}
proved that the L-function associated with the symmetric
square of a cusp form is entire. See also the footnote in Selberg's paper
\cite{MR1220477} that suggests that
Selberg had discovered  this many years earlier.
  
In 1977 Asai \cite{MR0429751} obtained the holomorphy and functional equation of certain
degree 4 L-functions associated with Hilbert modular forms over quadratic fields.
These are known as Asai L-functions.

Beginning in 1978 Shahidi \cite{MR0498494} and completed 
in 1999 with Kim \cite{MR1726704} proved that the symmetric cube 
of a GL(2) L-function is entire and has 
functional equation.

In 1980 Langlands proved Artin's conjecture for 2-dimensional representations of 
tetrahedral type (and also for certain octahedral 
representations) \cite{MR0574808}.
In 1981 Tunnell proved Artin's conjecture for octahedral representations \cite{MR0621884}.

In  work  beginning in 1981 with \cite{MR0610479},  Shahidi
proved the holomorphy and functional equation for many automorphic L-functions.

In 1983 Jacquet,  Piatetskii-Shapiro, and  Shalika \cite{MR0701565}obtained the meromorphicity and
functional equation for the L-function that is a general Rankin-Selberg convolution
of automorphic L-functions.

In 1995 Andrew Wiles \cite{MR1333035} proved the holomorphy and functional equation of the Hasse-Weil zeta-function
of most elliptic curves. In 2001 this work was extended by Breuil, Conrad, Diamond, and Taylor 
to include all elliptic curves \cite{MR1839918}.
