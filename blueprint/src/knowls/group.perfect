\subsection{Perfect groups}
\begin{definition}\label{group.perfect}
\uses{group,group.commutator_subgroup}
A {{KNOWL('group','group')}} $G$ is **perfect** if it is equal to its own {{KNOWL('group.commutator_subgroup', 'commutator subgroup')}} $G'$. Equivalently, $G$ has no non-trivial cyclic (equivalently abelian, equivalently soluble) quotients. All non-abelian simple and quasisimple groups are perfect. 

A perfect group may have cyclic composition factors, for example, $\mathrm{SL}(2,5)=C_2.A_5$ is perfect.
