Modular curves are identified in the literature using several different labeling conventions.  In addition to the \hyperref[modcurve.standard]{standard names} for the classical modular curves $X(N), X_0(N), X_1(N), X_{\mathrm ns}^+(N), X_{\mathrm sp}^+(N)$, etc., there are a number of labeling systems that are used in different contexts, including:

\begin{itemize}
\item  \textbf{(CP)} Cummins and Pauli labels $\texttt{NA}^\texttt{g}$,are used to identify congruence subgroups of $\PSL_2(\Z)$ of level $N$ and genus $g\le 24$ on \href{https://mathstats.uncg.edu/sites/pauli/congruence/}{this site}, which is based on \cite{mr:2016709}.<br>  Note that Cummins and Pauli work up to $\PGL_2(\Z)$-conjugacy, thus for some open $H$ in $\GL_2(\widehat\Z)$ the group $\pm H\cap \SL_2(\widehat \Z)$ may have more than one CP label.
\item  \textbf{(RZB)} Rouse and Zureick-Brown labels $X\texttt{m}$ with $1\le m\le 727$ are used for modular curves $X_H$ of $2$-power level on \href{https://users.wfu.edu/rouseja/2adic/}{this site}, based on \cite{doi:10.1007/s40993-015-0013-7}.<br>  Note that Rouse and Zureick-Brown put the action on the right, rather than the left (so one should transpose $H$ when comparing with their tables).
\item  \textbf{(RSZB)} Rouse, Sutherland, and Zureick-Brown labels $\texttt{N.i.g.n}$ identify open subgroups of $\GL_2(\widehat\Z)$ according to their level $N$, index $i$, and genus $g$, as defined in \cite{doi:10.1017/fms.2022.38}.
\item  \textbf{(S)} Sutherland labels $\texttt{NS.a.b.c}$ for groups of prime level $N$ were introduced in \cite{arXiv:1504.07618,MR:3482279} and are used to identify \hyperref[ec.galois_rep_modell_image]{mod-$\ell$ Galois images}.
\item  \textbf{(SZ)} Sutherland and Zywina labels $\texttt{MA}^\texttt{g}\texttt{-Na}$ are used in \cite{arXiv:1605.03988,mr:3671434} to identify modular curves of prime power level with infinitely many rational points.
