\subsection{Genus-rank difference}
\begin{definition}\label{modcurve.genus_minus_rank}
\uses{ag.jacobian,ag.mordell_weil,modcurve,modcurve.genus,modcurve.rank}
The **genus-rank difference** of a {{KNOWL('modcurve', 'modular curve')}} $X_H$ of positive genus is the integer obtained by subtracting the {{KNOWL('modcurve.rank','analytic rank')}} of $X_H$ from its {{KNOWL('modcurve.genus','genus')}}.  

This difference is of interest because the methods available to compute the set of rational points on $X_H$ depend critically on whether the {{KNOWL('ag.mordell_weil', 'Mordell-Weil rank')}} of its {{KNOWL('ag.jacobian', 'Jacobian')}} is less than, equal to, or greater than its genus (one expects the Mordell-Weil rank to equal the analytic rank of $X_H$ and the later is much more feasible to compute).
\end{definition}
