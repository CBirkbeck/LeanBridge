\subsection{Embedding of a Sato-Tate group}
\begin{definition}\label{st_group.embedding}
\uses{st_group.ambient,st_group.definition}
In order to explicitly compute moments and other invariants of a {{KNOWL('st_group.definition', 'Sato-Tate group')}} it is necessary to specify (up to conjugacy) exactly how it is embedded in its {{KNOWL('st_group.ambient', 'ambient group')}}; for example, subgroups that are isomorphic as real Lie groups may have different distributions of characteristic polynomials.

\end{definition}
