If $G$ is a \hyperref[group.permutation_representation]{transitive} subgroup of $S_n$, then we draw $n$ dots to represent the numbers from $1$ to $n$.  For each \hyperref[group.generators]{generator} of the \hyperref[group]{group}, we draw an arrow from the $i$th dot to the $j$th dot if the permutation sends $i$ to $j$.  There are no arrows drawn for fixed points, and a transposition is represented by a single double-headed arrow.  One color is assigned to each generator for its arrows.

For groups where the diagram has not yet been created, we display a picture of Ã‰variste Galois.

## Implementation ##

Diagrams were created by John Jones using the package graphviz.
