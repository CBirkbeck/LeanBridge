\subsection{\href{https://beta.lmfdb.org/knowledge/show/portrait.ec.q}{Pictures for elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$}}
\begin{definition}\label{portrait.ec.q}
\uses{ec.q,sage}
For each \hyperref[ec.q]{elliptic curve}  $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, the plot displayed is of part of $E(\mathbb{R})$, the set of real points of $E$.

The plots are produced using \hyperref[sage]{SageMath}, which uses plotting logic designed by David Roe to determine which subset of $E(\mathbb{R})$ in the real affine plane to include in the plot.
\end{definition}
