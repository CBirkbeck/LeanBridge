\subsection{Algebraic varieties}
\begin{definition}\label{mf.gl2.history.varieties}
\uses{ag.abelian_surface,ag.endomorphism_ring,ag.variety,ec.q,g2c.isogeny_class,group.paramodular,lfunction.dirichlet_series,lfunction.euler_product,lfunction.functional_equation,lfunction.riemann,mf,mf.transformation_property,nf}
A much deeper occurrence of {{KNOWL('mf', "modular forms")}} comes from the theory of {{KNOWL('ag.variety', "algebraic varieties")}} over $\Q$, or more generally over a {{KNOWL('nf', "number field")}}: to such an object one can associate in a natural way one or several {{KNOWL('lfunction.dirichlet_series', "Dirichlet series")}} defined as {{KNOWL('lfunction.euler_product', "Euler products")}} involving the number of points of the variety over all finite fields. It is *conjectured*, and far from proved, that *all* these Dirichlet series satisfy similar properties to that of the {{KNOWL('lfunction.riemann', "Riemann zeta function")}} $\zeta(s)$ and generalizations: meromorphic continuation to the whole complex plane with known poles, a {{KNOWL('lfunction.functional_equation', "functional equation")}} when $s\mapsto k-s$ for suitable $k$, and so forth. The existence of this functional equation together with suitable regularity conditions is closely linked to the fact that the function $\sum_{n\ge1}a(n)q^n$ has a {{KNOWL('mf.transformation_property', "modularity")}} property. In the specific case of {{KNOWL('ec.q', "elliptic curves defined over $\Q$")}}, this has been proved, giving another much deeper source of modular forms (of weight $2$ and trivial multiplier system) linked to elliptic curves.

Much more recently, Brumer&#8210;Kramer have conjectured a similar connection
between {{KNOWL('g2c.isogeny_class', "isogeny classes")}} of {{KNOWL('ag.abelian_surface', "abelian surfaces")}} defined over $\Q$ with {{KNOWL('ag.endomorphism_ring', "endomorphism ring")}} reduced to $\Z$ and certain modular forms on a subgroup of $\Sp_4(\Q)$ 
called the {{KNOWL('group.paramodular', "paramodular group")}}.
