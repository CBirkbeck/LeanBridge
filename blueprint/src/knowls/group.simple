\subsection{Simple groups}
\begin{definition}\label{group.simple}
\uses{group,group.abelian,group.cyclic,group.order,group.subgroup.normal}
A non-trivial {{KNOWL('group', 'group')}} $G$ is **simple** its only {{KNOWL('group.subgroup.normal', 'normal')}} subgroups are the trivial group and $G$ itself. 

Finite simple groups are building blocks for all finite groups, via extensions, and they are divided into {{KNOWL('group.cyclic', 'cyclic')}} groups of prime {{KNOWL('group.order', 'order')}} and the {{KNOWL('group.abelian', 'nonabelian')}} simple groups. For small orders, nonabelian simple groups they are all alternating or linear.
