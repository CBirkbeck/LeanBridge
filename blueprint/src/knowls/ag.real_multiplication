\subsection{Real multiplication}
\begin{definition}\label{ag.real_multiplication}
\uses{ag.abelian_variety,ag.endomorphism_algebra}
An {{KNOWL("ag.abelian_variety", "abelian variety")}} is said to have **real multiplication** (RM) if its {{KNOWL('ag.endomorphism_algebra', 'endomorphism algebra')}} is a totally real (number) field.  (In most situations, we exclude the trivial case of RM by $\Q$.)
\end{definition}
