\subsection{The type of a hypergeometric motive}
\begin{definition}\label{hgm.type}
\uses{hgm.motive,hgm.motivic_galois_group,hgm.weight}
A {{ KNOWL('hgm.motive', 'hypergeometric motive') }} $M$ of {{ KNOWL('hgm.weight', 'weight') }} $w$ is of **orthogonal** or **symplectic** **type** according as $w$ is even or odd. This corresponds to the fact that the {{ KNOWL('hgm.motivic_galois_group', 'motivic Galois group') }} of $M$ is either a subgroup of the conformal orthogonal group or conformal symplectic group depending on the parity of $w$.
\end{definition}
