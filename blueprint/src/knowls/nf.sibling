\subsection{Sibling fields and algebras}
\begin{definition}\label{nf.sibling}
\uses{nf.galois_closure,nf.separable}
Two finite {{ KNOWL('nf.separable',  'separable extension fields') }} $K_1$ and $K_2$ of a ground field $F$ are called **siblings** if they are not isomorphic, but have isomorphic {{ KNOWL('nf.galois_closure', 'Galois closures') }}.

A finite dimensional separable $\Q$-algebra is isomorphic to a product of number fields.  By its Galois closure, we mean the compositum of the Galois closures of the constituent fields.  Then two algebras are **siblings** if they have isomorphic Galois closures, but are not isomorphic as $\Q$-algebras.
\end{definition}
