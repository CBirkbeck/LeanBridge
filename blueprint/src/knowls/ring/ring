\begin{definition}\label{ring}
\uses{alg.binary_operation,alg.binary_operation.associative,alg.binary_operation.commutative,alg.binary_operation.identity,group.abelian}
A \textbf{ring} is a set $R$ with two \hyperref[alg.binary_operation]{binary operations} $+$ and $\cdot$ such that

1. $R$ is an \hyperref[group.abelian]{abelian group} with respect to $+$
2. $\cdot$ is \hyperref[alg.binary_operation.associative]{associative} on $R$
3. the distributive laws hold, i.e., for all $a,b,c\in R$,
$$ a\cdot(b+c) = a\cdot b+a\cdot c \qquad \text{and}\qquad (b+c)\cdot a = b\cdot a+c\cdot a$$
4. there is an \hyperref[alg.binary_operation.identity]{identity element} with respect to the operation $\cdot$, typically denoted by $1_R$ or, more simply, by $1$.

The \hyperref[alg.binary_operation.identity]{identity} element of $R$ as a group with respect to $+$ is typically denoted by $0_R$ or, more simply, by $0$.

The ring $R$ is a \textbf{commutative ring} if $R$ is a ring such that the operation $\cdot$ is \hyperref[alg.binary_operation.commutative]{commutative} on $R$.

We say that $R$ is a \textbf{rng} (also called \textbf{ring without identity}) if conditions 1-3 (but not necessarily 4) are satisfied.
