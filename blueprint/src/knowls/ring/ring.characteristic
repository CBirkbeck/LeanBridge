\begin{definition*}\label{ring.characteristic}
\uses{group,ring,ring.field}
The \textbf{characteristic} of a \hyperref[ring]{ring} is the least positive integer $n$ for which
\[
\underbrace{1+\cdots + 1}_n = 0,
\]
if such an $n$ exists, and $0$ otherwise. Equivalently, it is the exponent of the additive \hyperref[group]{group} of the ring.

The characteristic of a \hyperref[ring.field]{field} $k$ is either $0$ or a prime number $p$, depending on whether the prime field of $k$ is isomorphic to $\Q$ or $\F_p$.
