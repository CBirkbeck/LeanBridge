\subsection{Torsion growth in number fields}
\begin{definition}\label{ec.q.torsion_growth}
\uses{ec,ec.torsion_subgroup,nf,nf.degree}
Let $E$ be an {{ KNOWL('ec', 'elliptic curve')}} defined over $\Q$ and let $K$ be a {{ KNOWL('nf', 'number field') }}.  We say that there is **torsion growth** from $\Q$ to $K$ if the {{ KNOWL('ec.torsion_subgroup', 'torsion subgroup') }} $E(K)_{\rm tor}$ of $E(K)$ is strictly larger than $E(\Q)_{\rm tor}$.



If there is torsion growth in a field $K$ then obviously the torsion also grows in every extension of $K$.  We say that the torsion growth in $K$ is **primitive** if $E(K)_{\rm tor}$ is strictly larger than $E(K')_{\rm tor}$ for all proper subfields $K' \subsetneq K$.

For every elliptic curve $E$ there is torsion growth in at least one field of {{KNOWL('nf.degree', 'degree')}} $2$, $3$, or $4$, and torsion can only grow in fields whose degree is divisible by $2$, $3$, $5$ or $7$:  see Theorem 7.2 of 
\cite{doi:10.1090/mcom/3478}.  Additionally, there is no primitive torsion growth in fields of degrees $22$ or $26$: see  Lemma 2.11 of \cite{doi:10.1080/10586458.2020.1771638}.  Hence the only degrees less than $24$ in which primitive torsion growth occurs are $2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,14,15,16,18,20,21$.
