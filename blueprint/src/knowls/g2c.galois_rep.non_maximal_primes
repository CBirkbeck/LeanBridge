\subsection{Nonmaximal primes associated to genus $2$ curve}
\begin{definition}\label{g2c.galois_rep.non_maximal_primes}
\uses{ag.geom_endomorphism_ring,ag.jacobian,g2c.g2curve,g2c.galois_rep,g2c.st_group}
The **nonmaximal primes** associated to a {{KNOWL('g2c.g2curve','genus $2$ curve')}} are the finitely many primes $\ell$ for which the image of the mod-$\ell$ {{ KNOWL('g2c.galois_rep', 'Galois representation')}} is not as large as possible, subject to constraints imposed by the {{KNOWL('ag.geom_endomorphism_ring', 'geometric endomorphism ring')}} of the {{KNOWL('ag.jacobian', 'Jacobian')}} of $C$.

This information is currently available only for genus 2 curves whose Jacobian has geometric endomorphism ring $\Z$, equivalently, curves with {{KNOWL('g2c.st_group', 'Sato-Tate group')}} $\mathrm{USp}(4)$.  In this case the nonmaximal primes are simply the primes $\ell$ for which the mod-$\ell$ {{ KNOWL('g2c.galois_rep', 'Galois representation')}} is not surjective.
