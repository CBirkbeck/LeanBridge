\subsection{Input for arithmetically equivalent fields}
\begin{definition}\label{gg.arithmetically_equiv_input}
\uses{nf,nf.arithmetically_equivalent,nf.galois_closure,nf.galois_group}
Suppose a {{KNOWL('nf', 'number field')}} $K$ has {{KNOWL('nf.galois_closure', 'Galois closure')}} with {{KNOWL('nf.galois_group', 'Galois group')}} $G$, has $k$ {{KNOWL('nf.arithmetically_equivalent', 'arithmetically equivalent fields')}}, not including itself.  The number $k$ is an invariant of the Galois group $G$.

The number $k$ has not been computed for all Galois groups.  To see groups for which it has not been computed, use the value $-1$.
\end{definition}
