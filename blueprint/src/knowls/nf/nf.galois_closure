\subsection{Galois closure of an extension}
\begin{definition}\label{nf.galois_closure}
\uses{nf.separable}
If $K$ is a {{ KNOWL('nf.separable', 'separable') }} algebraic extension of a field $F$, then its **Galois closure** is the smallest extension field, in terms of inclusion, which contains $K$ and is Galois over $F$.  If $K=F(\alpha)$ where $\alpha$ has irreducible polynomial $f$ over $F$, then the Galois closure of $K$ is the splitting field of $f$ over $F$.
\end{definition}
