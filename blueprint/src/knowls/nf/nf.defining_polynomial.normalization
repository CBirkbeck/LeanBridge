\begin{definition}\label{nf.defining_polynomial.normalization}
\uses{nf.defining_polynomial,nf.polredabs}
A number field can be \hyperref[nf.defining_polynomial]{defined} by many different irreducible polynomials $f(x)\in\Q[x]$.
The normalized polynomial is the \hyperref[nf.polredabs]{output of gp/pari's <code>polredabs</code>}, which is effectively a canonically chosen defining polynomial.

Normalized polynomials are always monic with integer coefficients, such that the sum of the squares of the absolute values of all complex roots of $f(x)$ is minimized.  When there is more than one such polynomial, the tie is broken based on the size of the polynomial's coefficients and discriminant.
