\begin{definition*}\label{nf.narrow_class_group}
\uses{nf,nf.totally_positive}
The \textbf{narrow class group} (also called the \textbf{strict class group}) of a \hyperref[nf]{number field} $K$ is the group of equivalence classes of ideals, given by the quotient of the multiplicative group of all fractional ideals of $K$ by the subgroup of principal fractional ideals which have a \hyperref[nf.totally_positive]{totally positive} generator.  It is a
finite abelian group whose order is the \hyperref[nf.narrow_class_number]{narrow class number}.
