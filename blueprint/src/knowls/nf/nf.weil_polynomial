\begin{definition*}\label{nf.weil_polynomial}
\uses{ag.abelian_variety,av.simple}
For a prime power $q$, a \textbf{Weil $q$-polynomial} is a monic polynomial with integer coefficients whose complex roots are of absolute value $\sqrt{q}$.

Given $q$ and a nonnegative integer $d$, there are only finitely many Weil $q$-polynomials of degree $d$.

The \hyperref[av.fq.weil_polynomial]{characteristic polynomial} of an \hyperref[ag.abelian_variety]{abelian variety} over $\F_q$ is a Weil $q$-polynomial, but it is not quite true that every Weil $q$-polynomial arises in this way.  Every irreducible Weil $q$-polynomial has a unique power that is the characteristic polynomial of a \hyperref[av.simple]{simple abelian variety} over $\F_q$; it is the products of these powers that arise from abelian varieties.
