\subsection{Twin sextic algebra}
\begin{definition}\label{nf.sextic_twin}
\uses{nf.separable_algebra}
If $A$ is a {{KNOWL('nf.separable_algebra', 'separable algebra')}} of degree 6 over a field $F$ (so $\dim_F A=6$), then it has a _twin algebra_ $B$ that is also a separable algebra of degree 6 over $F$; the $F$-algebras $A$ and $B$ are related by the non-trivial outer automorphism of $S_6$. 

The symmetric group $S_n$ has a non-trivial outer automorphism if and only if $n=6$, in which case it is unique up to inner automorphisms.  This automorphism interchanges $S_5\leq S_6$ with $\PGL_2(5)\leq S_6$.  In terms of Galois theory, this inclusion gives an absolute resolvent of degree $[G:\PGL_2(5)]=6$.

A common situation is when $A$ is a field but $B$ is not.  Then the nature of the factorization of $B$ assists in the study of $A$.
