\begin{definition}\label{nf.algebraic_closure}
\uses{nf}
An algebraic closure of a field $K$ is a minimal algebraically closed field extension of $K$.  It is unique up to (non-canonical) isomorphism. It is usually denoted $\overline{K}$.

For any \hyperref[nf]{number field}, its algebraic closure is usually denoted by $\overline{\Q}$, and it is isomorphic to the field of all algebraic numbers in $\C$.
