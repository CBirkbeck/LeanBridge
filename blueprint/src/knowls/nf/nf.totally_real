\subsection{Totally real}
\begin{definition}\label{nf.totally_real}
\uses{nf}
A {{ KNOWL('nf', "global number field") }} $K$ is always of the form $K=\Q(\alpha)$ where $\alpha$ has monic irreducible polynomial $f(x)\in\Q[x]$.  The field is **totally real** if all of the roots of $f(x)$ in $\C$ lie in the real numbers $\R$.  

Equivalently, $K$ is totally real if all the embeddings of $K$ into $\C$ have image contained in $\R$.
\end{definition}
