\begin{definition}\label{nf.serre_odlyzko_bound}
\uses{lfunction.rh,nf,nf.degree,nf.root_discriminant}
For each positive integer $n$, let $C_n$ for the minimum \hyperref[nf.root_discriminant]{root discriminant} for all \hyperref[nf]{number fields} of \hyperref[nf.degree]{degree} $n$.  Assuming the \hyperref[lfunction.rh]{Generalized Riemann Hypothesis}, $\limsup C_n \geq \Omega$ where
$$ \Omega = 8\pi e^\gamma\approx 44.7632\ldots$$ 
and $\gamma$ is the Eulerâ€“Mascheroni constant.  Lower bounds for the $C_n$ were deduced by analytic methods through the work of Odlyzko and others.  In particular, Serre introduced the constant $\Omega$ which  we refer to as the \textbf{Serre Odlyzko bound},

Consequently, any number field whose root discriminant lies below $\Omega$ can be considered to have small discriminant.
