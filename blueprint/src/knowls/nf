\subsection{Number field}
\begin{definition}\label{nf}
\uses{nf.degree,nf.label}
A **number field** is a finite degree field extension of the field $\Q$ of rational numbers. In LMFDB, number fields are identified by a {{ KNOWL("nf.label", "label")}}.

{# Note:  I left out the knowl for degree here, since it is technically defining the degree of a number field, rather than a general field extension (which is suggested by this definition)... {{ KNOWL('nf.degree', "degree") }} #}
\end{definition}
