\subsection{Totally imaginary}
\begin{definition}\label{nf.totally_imaginary}
\uses{nf}
A {{KNOWL('nf', "number field")}} $K$ is **totally imaginary** (or **totally complex**) if it cannot be embedded in the real numbers $\R$; equivalently, $\R$ does not contain the image of any of the homomorphisms from $K$ to $\C$.

\end{definition}
