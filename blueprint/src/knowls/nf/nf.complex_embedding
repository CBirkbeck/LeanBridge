\begin{definition*}\label{nf.complex_embedding}
\uses{nf,nf.minimal_polynomial}
A \textbf{complex embedding} of a \hyperref[nf]{number field} $K$ is a nonzero field homomorphism $K\to \C$ whose image is not contained in $\R$.  

A single number field may have several distinct complex embeddings.

For $K=\Q(a)$ where $a$ is an algebraic number with \hyperref[nf.minimal_polynomial]{minimal polynomial} $f(X)$, the embeddings $\iota:K\to\C$ are determined by the value $z=\iota(a)$ which is one of the complex roots of $f(X)$, and the embedding is complex when $z\notin\R$.  The complex embeddings come in conjugate pairs.
