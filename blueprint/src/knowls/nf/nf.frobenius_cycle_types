If $K$ is a degree $n$ extension of $\mathbb{Q}$, $\hat K$ its normal closure and $G=\text{Gal}(\hat K/\mathbb{Q})$, then $G$ acts on the set of $n$ embeddings of $K\to \hat K$ giving an embedding $G\to S_n$.  Let $\mathcal{O}_K$ be the ring of integers of $K$ and $p$ a prime number.  Then
\[ p\mathcal{O}_K = P_1^{e_1}\cdots P_g^{e_g}\]
where the $P_i$ are distinct prime ideals of $\mathcal{O}_K$.  The prime $p$ is \textbf{unramified} if $e_i=1$ for all $i$.

Suppose hereafter that $p$ is unramified. For each $P_i$, there is a unique element
of $G$ that fixes $P_i$ and acts on the quotient $\mathcal{O}_K/P_i$ via the Frobenius automorphism $x \mapsto x^p$; this element is the \textbf{Frobenius element} associated to $P_i$. The Frobenius elements associated to the different $P_i$ are conjugate to each other, so their images in $S_n$ all have the same lengths of cycles in their disjoint cycle decompositions. This is the \textbf{Frobenius cycle type} of $p$.

Alternatively, for each prime $P_i$, its \textbf{residue degree} $f_i$ is defined by $|\mathcal{O}_K/P_i| = p^{f_i}$.  The list of $f_i$ is the same partition of $n$ as the cycle decomposition described above.
