\uses{nf,nf.class_number,nf.ideal_class_group,nf.narrow_class_group,nf.totally_imaginary}
The \textbf{narrow class number} (also called the \textbf{strict class number}) of an \hyperref[nf]{algebraic number field} is the order of its \hyperref[nf.narrow_class_group]{narrow class group}.
Since the ordinary \hyperref[nf.ideal_class_group]{ideal class group} is a quotient of the \hyperref[nf.narrow_class_group]{narrow class group}, the narrow class number is a multiple of the \hyperref[nf.class_number]{class number}.  Moreover, the ratio is a power of $2$. The two class numbers are the same in many cases, for example when the number field is \hyperref[nf.totally_imaginary]{totally complex}.
