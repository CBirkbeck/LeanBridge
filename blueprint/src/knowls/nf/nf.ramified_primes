\subsection{Ramified (rational) prime of a number field}
\begin{definition}\label{nf.ramified_primes}
\uses{}
A prime integer $p$ is a **ramified prime** of a number field $K$ if, when the ideal generated by $p$ is factored into prime ideals in the ring of integers
$\mathcal{O}_K$ of $K$, 
$$p\mathcal{O}_K= \mathcal{P_1}^{e_1}\cdots \mathcal{P_k}^{e_k},$$  
there is an $i$ such that $e_i\geq 2$.

The ramified primes of $K$ are the primes dividing the {{ KNOWL('nf.discriminant', "discriminant") }} of $K$.
