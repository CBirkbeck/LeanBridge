\subsection{Hilbert modular form convention for the label of a number field ideal}
\begin{definition}\label{nf.ideal.label.hmf}
\uses{}
In the Hilbert modular form pages, an ideal $I$ of a number field is represented by the label $[N,m,\alpha]$, where $N$ is the absolute norm of the ideal, $m$ is the smallest rational integer in the ideal, and $\alpha$ is an element chosen so that $(m,\alpha)=I$.
\end{definition}
