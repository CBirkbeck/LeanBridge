\begin{definition}\label{lf.visible_slopes}
\uses{lf.discriminant_exponent,lf.hidden_slopes,lf.wild_slopes,nf.is_galois}
Let $K$ be a finite extension of $\Q_p$.  If we plot points $(n_E,c_E)$ for each intermediate field $\Q_p\subseteq E \subseteq K$, including $K$ and $\Q_p$, where $n_E=[E:\Q_p]$ and $c_E$ its \hyperref[lf.discriminant_exponent]{discriminant} exponent. Take the lower convex hull of these points.

The \textbf{visible Artin slopes} of $K$ correspond to segments which have slopes greater than one.  For such a segment from $(n_1, c_1)$ to $(n_2, c_2)$, $n_2/n_1=p^k$ for some $k\in\Z^+$, and that slope is listed $k$ times.  If $[s_1,\ldots,s_k]$ are the visible Artin slopes, then the \textbf{visible Swan slopes} are $[s_1-1,\ldots,s_k-1]$.

For a \hyperref[nf.is_galois]{Galois} extension $K/\Q_p$, the visible Artin slopes are the same as the \hyperref[lf.wild_slopes]{wild Artin slopes} of the extension.  For a general extension, the list of visible Artin slopes is a subset of the list of wild Artin slopes of its Galois closure.  The \hyperref[lf.hidden_slopes]{hidden slopes} of $K$ are obtained by removing (as multisets) the visible slopes of $K$ from the set of all slopes of the Galois closure.
