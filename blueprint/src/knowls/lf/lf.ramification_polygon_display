The blue graph shows the \hyperref[lf.ramification_polygon]{ramification polygon}.

\begin{itemize}
\item  The blue number to the right of each segment is its slope.
\item  Coordinates are given for the black points at $(-p^j, i_j)$ where $[i_0,...,i_{\nu}]$ are the \hyperref[lf.indices_of_inseparability]{indices of inseparability}. These points include the vertices of the ramification polygon.  In some cases there are additional points on or above the polygon.
\item  Each \hyperref[lf.residual_polynomials]{residual polynomial} $A(z)$ of
\end{itemize}
$L/K$ is associated to a segment $S$ of the ramification polygon;
if $S$ has positive slope then the coefficients of the polynomial come from the
black points which lie on the segment.  More precisely, assume that $S$ has right
endpoint $(-p^k,i_k)$, left endpoint $(-p^l,i_l)$, and slope $h/m>0$.  Let
$k\le j\le l$.  If there is a black point on $S$ with
first coordinate $-p^j$ then the coefficient of $x^{p^j}$ in the additive
polynomial $x^{p^k}A(x^m)$ is given by the label attached to this point.  Otherwise
the coefficient of $x^{p^j}$ is 0.
\begin{itemize}
\item  Since successive segments of the ramification polygon share a vertex,
\end{itemize}
the constant term of each residual polynomial is equal to the
leading coefficient of the next.
