\begin{definition*}\label{lf.local_field}
\uses{nf.absolute_value,ring.characteristic,ring.field}
A \textbf{local field} is a \hyperref[ring.field]{field} $K$ with a non-trivial \hyperref[nf.absolute_value]{absolute value} $|\ |$ that is locally compact in the topology induced by the distance metric $d(x,y):=|x-y|$.

An \textbf{archimedean local field} is a local field whose absolute value is \hyperref[nf.absolute_value]{archimedean}; such a field is isomorphic to $\R$ or $\C$.

A \textbf{nonarchimedean local field} is a local field whose absolute value is \hyperref[nf.absolute_value]{nonarchimedean}. Such a field is either isomorphic to a finite extension of $\Q_p$ when $K$ has \hyperref[ring.characteristic]{characteristic} zero (in which case it is a \hyperref[lf.padic_field]{$p$-adic field}), or to a finite extension of $\F_p((t))$ when $K$ has characteristic $p$.  In both cases $p$ is the characteristic of the \hyperref[lf.residue_field]{residue field} of $K$..
