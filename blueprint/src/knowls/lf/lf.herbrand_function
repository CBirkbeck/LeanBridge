\subsection{Herbrand function of a family}
\begin{definition}\label{lf.herbrand_function}
\uses{lf.family_polynomial,lf.indices_of_inseparability,lf.means,lf.padic_field,lf.rams,lf.slopes}
Let $I/K$ be a {{KNOWL('lf.family_polynomial', 'family')}} of extensions of
a {{KNOWL('lf.padic_field', '$p$-adic field')}} $K$.
We can express $I$ in terms of {{KNOWL('lf.rams', 'rams')}}
as $I=(r_1,\dots,r_w)_{\epsilon}^f$, in terms of
{{KNOWL('lf.slopes', 'Swan slopes')}} as
$I=[s_1,\dots,s_w]_{\epsilon}^f$ or in terms of the {{KNOWL('lf.means', 'means')}} $\langle m_1,\dots,m_w\rangle_\epsilon^f$.  The **Herbrand function** of $I/K$ is
the piecewise linear function $\phi_{I/K}:\R_{\ge0}\rightarrow\R_{\ge0}$
whose graph is obtained by joining the points
$(0,0),(r_1,s_1),\dots,(r_w,s_w)$ with
line segments; in addition, there is a ray with slope $1/(\epsilon p^w)$
starting at $(r_w,s_w)$.  It follows that for $1\le i\le w$ the segment
whose right endpoint is $(r_i,s_i)$ has slope $1/(\epsilon p^{i-1})$.

The rams of $I/K$ are labeled in blue on the horizontal axis of the diagram.
The wild Swan slopes of $I/K$ are labeled in black on the vertical axis of the
diagram; to the left of each Swan slope is a rescaling by a factor
$\epsilon p^w$.  The green numbers along the vertical axis are the means.
The rescaled green numbers on the left which correspond to
intersections of the vertical axis with extensions of segments of the graph
of $\phi_{I/K}$ give some of the
{{KNOWL('lf.indices_of_inseparability', 'indices of inseparability')}} of
the extensions $L/K$ in $I/K$.
