\subsection{Galois invariants of a local field}
\begin{definition}\label{lf.galois_invariants}
\uses{lf.padic_field,nf.galois_group,nf.root_discriminant}
Let $K^{gal}$ be the Galois closure of a {{ KNOWL('lf.padic_field', '$p$-adic field') }} $K$. The first Galois invariant of $K$ is the {{ KNOWL('nf.galois_group', "Galois group") }} $G=\Gal(K^{gal}/\mathbb{Q}_p)$.  Most of the remaining invariants relate to the filtration on $G$ by higher ramification groups.

Let $G^i$ be the $i$th higher ramification group in upper numbering from Serre's <i>Local Fields</i> \cite{doi:10.1007/978-1-4757-5673-9}.  They form a descending filtration of normal subgroups where $i$ is a continuous parameter, $i\geq -1$.  Let $G^{(j)} = G^{j-1}$, and $G^{(j+)} = \cap_{\epsilon>0} G^{(j+\epsilon)}$.  Then

- $G^{(0)}=G$.

- $G^{(1)}$ is the **inertia subgroup** of $G$, i.e., the kernel of the natural map from $G$ to the {{ KNOWL('nf.galois_group', "Galois group") }} of the residue field.

- the fixed field of $G^{(1)}$ is the maximum unramified subfield of $K^{gal}/\Q_p$, which we denote by $K^{unram}$.  The degree $[K^{unram}:\mathbb{Q}_p]$ is the **unramified degree** for $K^{gal}/\Q_p$.  The extension $K^{gal}/K^{unram}$ is totally ramified.

- the group $G^{(1)}/G^{(1+)}$ is cyclic of order prime to $p$.  Its order is the **tame degree** for $K^{gal}/\Q_p$ as it is the degree of the largest tamely totally ramified subextension.  

- The group $G^{(1+)}$ is a $p$-group.  Values of $s>1$ giving jumps in the filtration $G^{(s)}\neq G^{(s+)}$ are **wild Artin slopes**.  We repeat a slope $m$ times if $p^m =[G^{(s)} : G^{(s+)}]$, and then list the wild slopes in non-decreasing order.  

- The **Galois Mean Slope** is the valuation of the {{ KNOWL('nf.root_discriminant', "root discriminant") }} of the Galois closure $K^{gal}/\Q_p$.  It can also be expressed as a weighted sum of the slopes.

- A **Galois Splitting Model** of a local field $K$ is a polynomial $f\in\Q[x]$ such that $K\cong \Q_p[x]/(f)$, and the Galois group for $f$ over $\Q_p$ equals the Galois group for $f$ over $\Q$.  In this case, computations in the splitting field of $f$ over $\Q_p$ can be computed more easily using the splitting field of $f$ over $\Q$.

- For each jump in the filtration $G^{i}\neq G^{i+}$ gives a **Swan slope** of $i$.  The Swan slopes are one less than the Artin slopes.
