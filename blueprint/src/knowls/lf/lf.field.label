Each \hyperref[lf.family_polynomial]{$p$-adic family} has a label of the form "p.f.e.cA", where

\begin{itemize}
\item  p is the \hyperref[lf.residue_field]{residue field characteristic},
\item  f is the \hyperref[lf.residue_field_degree]{residue field degree} of $K$ over $\mathbb{Q}_p$,
\item  e is the \hyperref[lf.ramification_index]{ramification index} of $K$ over $\mathbb{Q}_p$,
\item  c is the \hyperref[lf.discriminant_exponent]{discriminant exponent} of $K$ over $\mathbb{Q}_p$,
\item  A is a lower case letter code, with families sorted by their number of \hyperref[lf.wild_segments]{wild segments}, then the list of lengths of the wild segments, then the \hyperref[lf.rams]{rams}.
\end{itemize}

Each \hyperref[lf.padic_field]{$p$-adic field} $K$ has a label of the form "p.f.e.cAi.j", where

\begin{itemize}
\item  p.f.e.cA is the label of the family containing the field
\item  i is a positive integer code, shared among fields in the same family with equivalent \hyperref[lf.residual_polynomials]{residual polynomials}, sorted lexicographically by coefficients of the residual polynomial.
\item  j is a positive integer code, ordering fields in a given family with the same residual polynomials by their \hyperref[lf.defining_polynomial]{defining polynomial}, sorted lexicographically. 
\end{itemize}

Prior to 2025, local fields in the LMFDB had a different label convention, of the form p.n.c.num, where n was the \hyperref[lf.degree]{degree} and num was an integer code from an unspecified ordering.  If you have a field label in the old form, the website will translate it to the new label if you enter it in the "Find" box at the bottom of the browse page.
