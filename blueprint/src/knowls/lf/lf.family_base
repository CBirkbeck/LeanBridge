\begin{definition}\label{lf.family_base}
\uses{lf.family_polynomial,lf.padic_field}
A \hyperref[lf.family_polynomial]{family} of extensions of
\hyperref[lf.padic_field]{$p$-adic fields} is a collection of
extensions $L/K$ with $K$ a fixed $p$-adic field.  The field $K$
is called the \textbf{base field} of the family.
