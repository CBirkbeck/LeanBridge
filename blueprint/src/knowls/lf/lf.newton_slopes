\begin{definition}\label{lf.newton_slopes}
\uses{lf.local_field,lf.newton_polygon}
Given a polynomial $f$ defined over a \hyperref[lf.local_field]{nonarchimedean local field} $K$, the \textbf{slopes} of its \hyperref[lf.newton_polygon]{Newton polygon} are a list of increasing numbers $[s_1,s_2,s_3, \ldots]$ such that the Newton polygon of $f$ is given by a line segment of width 1 with slope $s_1$, followed by a line segment of width 1 with slope $s_2$, etc. Note that it is possible for a slope to appear multiple times if the Newton polygon has the same slope for a width of more than 1.
