\subsection{Hasse diagram}
\begin{definition}\label{combin.hasse_diagram}
\uses{}
If $(S, \leq)$ is a finite partially ordered set, then a **Hasse diagram** for $S$ is a representation of $S$ in the plane where

  * there is one node for each element of $S$
  * there is an edge connecting $s_1$ and $s_2$ if $s_1$ is maximal in $\leq$ for $\{s\in S \mid s < s_2\}$, or vice versa
  * if $s_1$ is connected to $s_2$ by an edge and $s_1 < s_2$, then $s_2$ is higher in the plane in the sense of having a larger "$y$-coordinate"

\end{definition}
