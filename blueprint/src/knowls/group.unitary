\subsection{Unitary group}
\begin{definition}\label{group.unitary}
\uses{group.center,group.quotient,group.subgroup,ring.field}
The **(general) unitary group** $\GU(n, q)$ is the group of $n \times n$ unitary matrices with entries in the {{KNOWL('ring.field', 'field')}} $\F_{q^2}$ (the finite field with $q^2$ elements).  Here, a matrix is *unitary* if the inverse of $M$ equals the conjugate transpose of $M$.

For matrices $M$ over the finite field $\F_{q^2}$, the *conjugate* of $M$ is defined as the matrix obtained by applying the map $x \mapsto x^q$ (i.e. the $r$-th power of the Frobenius automorphism, where $q = p^r$) to each entry of $M$.

The **projective (general) unitary group** $\PGU(n, q)$ is the {{KNOWL('group.quotient', 'quotient')}} of $\GU(n, q)$ by the scalar matrices in $\GU(n, q)$ (equivalently, $\PGU(n, q)$ is the quotient of $\GU(n, q)$ by its {{KNOWL('group.center', 'center')}}).

The **special unitary group** $\SU(n, q)$ is the {{KNOWL('group.subgroup', 'subgroup')}} of $\GU(n, q)$ consisting of those matrices with determinant 1.

The **projective special unitary group** $\PSU(n, q)$ is the quotient of $\SU(n, q)$ by the scalar matrices in $\SU(n, q)$ (equivalently, $\PSU(n, q)$ is the quotient of $\SU(n, q)$ by its center).
