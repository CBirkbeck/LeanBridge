\subsection{Label of irreducible complex characters of groups}
\begin{definition}\label{group.label_complex_group_char}
\uses{group}
The **label** of an irreducible complex character of a {{KNOWL('group', 'group')}} has the format $N.i.dcj$ where $N.i$ is the label for the group, $d$ is the dimension, $c$ is a lower-case letter code for the rational class of this character, and $j$ is an enumeration of characters within that rational class ($j$ is omitted if the rational class is a singleton).
\end{definition}
