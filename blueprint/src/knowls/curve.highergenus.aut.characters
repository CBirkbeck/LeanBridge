\subsection{Automorphism group characters}
\begin{definition}\label{curve.highergenus.aut.characters}
\uses{ag.curve.genus,ag.jacobian,curve.highergenus.aut.group_action,curve.highergenus.aut.groupalgebradecomp,group.complex_character_table,group.representation.character,group.representation.irrep}
If $G$ is a {{KNOWL('curve.highergenus.aut.group_action','group acting on a curve')}} $X/\C$ of {{KNOWL('ag.curve.genus', 'genus')}} $g$, the induced action of $G$ on the $g$-dimensional $\C$-vector space of holomorphic differentials of $X$ gives rise to a representation of $G$.  The {{KNOWL('curve.highergenus.aut.groupalgebradecomp','group algebra decomposition')}} of the {{KNOWL('ag.jacobian', 'Jacobian')}} of $X$ into a product $A_1^{e_1}\times \cdots\times A_r^{e_r}$ of powers of $r$ abelian varieties gives rise to $r$ {{KNOWL('group.representation.irrep','irreducible subrepresentations')}} of $G$, each of which has an {{KNOWL('group.representation.character', 'associated character')}}.

The character of each of these representations is identified by its index in the {{KNOWL('group.complex_character_table','character table')}} for $G$ as listed by Magma (which may differ from GAP).
