\subsection{Factorization of the group order}
\begin{definition}\label{group.order_factorization}
\uses{group.order}
You can provide the exponents for the factorization of the {{KNOWL('group.order', 'order')}} of the group into primes.  Enter them in descending order, not the order matching the primes.  So, for example, $18$ would be entered as [2, 1].
