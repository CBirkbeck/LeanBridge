\subsection{Analytic rank of a curve}
\begin{definition}\label{g2c.analytic_rank}
\uses{ag.abelian_variety,ag.curve,ag.jacobian,ag.mordell_weil,g2c.bsd_invariants,g2c.hasse_weil_conjecture,lfunction,lfunction.analytic_rank,lfunction.central_point,lfunction.functional_equation,lfunction.sign}
The **analytic rank** of an {{KNOWL("ag.abelian_variety", "abelian variety")}} is the {{KNOWL('lfunction.analytic_rank', 'analytic rank')}} of its {{KNOWL('lfunction', 'L-function')}} $L(A,s)$.  The analytic rank of a {{KNOWL("ag.curve", "curve")}} is the analytic rank of its {{KNOWL('ag.jacobian', 'Jacobian')}}.  The weak form of the {{ KNOWL('g2c.bsd_invariants', 'BSD conjecture') }} implies that the analytic rank is equal to the rank of the {{KNOWL('ag.mordell_weil', 'Mordell-Weil group')}} of the abelian variety.  

Analytic ranks are always computed under the assumption that $L(A,s)$ satisfies the {{KNOWL('g2c.hasse_weil_conjecture', 'Hasse-Weil conjecture')}} (they are not necessarily well-defined otherwise).  When $A$ is defined over $\Q$, the parity of the analytic rank is always compatible with the {{KNOWL('lfunction.sign', 'sign')}} of the {{KNOWL('lfunction.functional_equation', 'functional equation')}}.

In general, analytic ranks stored in the LMFDB are only upper bounds on the true analytic rank (they could be incorrect if $L(A,s)$ has a zero very close to but not on the {{KNOWL('lfunction.central_point', 'central point')}}).  For abelian varieties over $\Q$ of analytic rank less than 2 this upper bound is necessarily tight, due to parity.
