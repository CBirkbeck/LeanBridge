\subsection{Separable algebra}
\begin{definition}\label{nf.separable_algebra}
\uses{nf.separable}
A (finite) **separable algebra** $A$ over a field $F$, also called an **\'etale $F$-algebra**, is an  $F$-algebra of finite dimension that is isomorphic to a product of {{KNOWL('nf.separable', 'separable')}} field extensions of $F$.

If $L/K$ is a field extension and $A$ is a separable $K$-algebra then $A\otimes_K L$ is a separable $L$-algebra (which is typically not a field, even when $A$ is).
\end{definition}
