\begin{definition*}\label{ec.isomorphism}
\uses{ec,ec.isogeny}
An \textbf{isomorphism} between two \hyperref[ec]{elliptic curves} $E$, $E'$ defined over a field $K$ is an \hyperref[ec.isogeny]{isogeny} $f:E\to E'$ such that there exist an \hyperref[ec.isogeny]{isogeny} $g:E'\to E$ with the compositions $g\circ f$ and $f\circ g$ being the identity maps.  Equivalently, an isomorphism $E\to E'$ is an isogeny of degree $1$.

Isomorphism is an equivalence relation, the equivalnce classes being called \textbf{isomorphism classes}.

When $E$ and $E'$ are defined by \hyperref[ec.weierstrass_coeffs]{Weierstrass models}, such an isomorphism is uniquely represented as a \hyperref[ec.weierstrass_isomorphism]{Weierstrass isomorphism} between these models.
