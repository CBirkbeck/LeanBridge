\begin{definition}\label{ec.reduction_type}
\uses{ec,ec.bad_reduction,ec.good_reduction,nf,nf.ring_of_integers}
The \textbf{reduction type} of an \hyperref[ec]{elliptic curve} $E$ defined over a \hyperref[nf]{number field} \(K\) at a prime \(\mathfrak{p}\) of \(K\)
depends on the reduction $\tilde E$ of $E$ modulo $\mathfrak{p}$. Let $\F_q$ be the \hyperref[nf.ring_of_integers]{ring of integers} of $K$ modulo $\mathfrak{p}$, a finite field of characteristic $p$.

$E$ has \hyperref[ec.good_reduction]{good reduction} at $\mathfrak p$ if $\tilde E$ is non-singular over $\F_q$.   The reduction type is \textbf{ordinary} if $\tilde E$ is ordinary (equivalently, $\tilde E(\overline{\F_q})$ has $p$-torsion) and \textbf{supersingular} otherwise.

On the other hand, if the reduction of \(E\) modulo \(\mathfrak{p}\) is singular, then
$E$ has \hyperref[ec.bad_reduction]{bad reduction}.  There are two types of bad reduction are as follows.

$E$ has \textbf{multiplicative reduction} at $\mathfrak p$ if $\tilde E$ has a nodal singularity. It is called \textbf{split multiplicative reduction} if the two tangents at the node are defined over $\F_q$ and \textbf{non-split multiplicative reduction} otherwise.

$E$ has \textbf{additive reduction} at $\mathfrak p$ if $\tilde E$ has a cuspidal singularity.
