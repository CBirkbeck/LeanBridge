\begin{definition*}\label{ec.endomorphism_ring}
\uses{ag.abelian_variety,ag.endomorphism_ring,ec,ec.endomorphism}
The \textbf{endomorphism ring} $\End(E)$ of an \hyperref[ec]{elliptic curve} \(E\) over a field $K$ is the ring of all \hyperref[ec.endomorphism]{endomorphisms} of \(E\) defined over $K$.  For endomorphisms defined over extensions, we speak of the \hyperref[ec.geom_endomorphism_ring]{geometric endomorphism ring} of $E$.

For elliptic curves defined over fields of characteristic zero, this ring is isomorphic to \(\Z\), unless the curve has \hyperref[ec.complex_multiplication]{complex multiplication} (CM) defined over the ground field, in which case the endomorphism ring is an order in an imaginary quadratic field; for curves defined over \(\Q\), this order is one of the 13 orders of class number one.

$\End(E)$ always contains a subring isomorphic to $\Z$, since for $m\in\Z$ there is the multiplication-by-$m$ map $[m] \colon E\to E$.

This is a special case of the \hyperref[ag.endomorphism_ring]{endomorphism ring} of an \hyperref[ag.abelian_variety]{abelian variety}.
