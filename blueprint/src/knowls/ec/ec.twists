\uses{av.twist,ec,ec.j_invariant,g2c.aut_grp,ring.characteristic,ring.field}
A \textbf{twist} of an \hyperref[ec]{elliptic curve} $E$ defined over a \hyperref[ring.field]{field} $K$ is another elliptic curve $E'$, also defined over $K$, which is isomorphic to $E$ over the algebraic closure of $K$.

Two elliptic curves are twists if an only if they have the same \hyperref[ec.j_invariant]{$j$-invariant}.

For elliptic curves $E$ with $j(E)\not=0, 1728$, the only twists of $E$ are its \textbf{quadratic twists} $E^{(d)}$.  Provided that the \hyperref[ring.characteristic]{characteristic} of $K$ is not $2$, the nontrivial quadratic twists of $E$ are in bijection with the nontrivial elements $d$ of $K^*/(K^*)^2$, and  $E^{(d)}$ is isomorphic to $E$ over the quadratic extension $K(\sqrt{d})$.

Over fields of characteristic not $2$ or $3$, elliptic curves with $j$-invariant $1728$ also admit \textbf{quartic twists}, parametrised by $K^*/(K^*)^4$, and elliptic curves with $j$-invariant $0$ also admit \textbf{sextic twists}, parametrised by $K^*/(K^*)^6$.  Elliptic curves $E$ over fields $K$ of characteristic $2$ and $3$ with $j(E)=0=1728$ have nonabelian \hyperref[g2c.aut_grp]{automorphism} groups, and their twists are more complicated to describe, being in all cases parametrised by $H^1(\Gal(\overline{K}/K), \Aut(E))$.

Elliptic curve twists are a special case of \hyperref[av.twist]{twists of abelian varieties}.
