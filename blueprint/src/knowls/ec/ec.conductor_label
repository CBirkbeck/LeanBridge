The LMFDB uses a systematic labelling of \hyperref[ec.conductor]{conductors} of elliptic curves defined over each \hyperref[nf]{number field} $K$.  The conductors are integral ideals of $K$.  For an ideal of norm $N$ the label has the form $N.i$ where $i$ is the index (starting from $1$) of the ideal in an ordered list of all integral ideals of norm $N$.

\begin{itemize}
\item  over imaginary quadratic fields, we use the \hyperref[nf.ideal_labels]{standard labelling scheme} for ideals;
\item  over totally real fields, we use the same labels for ideals as are used for levels of Hilbert modular forms; the order of these is recorded in the database;
\item  over other fields, the ordering of the ideals of fixed norm is recorded in the database.
\end{itemize}

In future it is planned to move to using the \hyperref[nf.ideal_labels]{standard labelling scheme} for ideals over all fields.
\end{definition}
