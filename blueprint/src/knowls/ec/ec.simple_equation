\subsection{Simplified equation}
\begin{definition}\label{ec.simple_equation}
\uses{ec,ec.bad_reduction,ec.good_reduction,ec.q.minimal_weierstrass_equation,ring.characteristic,ring.field}
Every {{KNOWL('ec', 'elliptic curve')}} over a {{KNOWL('ring.field', 'field')}} $k$ whose {{KNOWL('ring.characteristic', 'characteristic')}} is not 2 or 3 has a **simplified equation** (or **short Weierstrass model**) of the form $y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$.  When $k=\mathbb Q$ is the field of rational numbers, one can choose $A$ and $B$ to be integers.

For elliptic curves over $\Q$ this model will necessarily have {{KNOWL('ec.bad_reduction', 'bad reduction')}} at 2, even when $E$ has {{KNOWL('ec.good_reduction', 'good reduction')}} at 2; it may also bad reduction at 3 even when the {{KNOWL('ec.q.minimal_weierstrass_equation','minimal model')}} of $E$ does not.
