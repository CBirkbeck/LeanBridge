\uses{ec}
A \textbf{Weierstrass equation} or \textbf{Weierstrass model} over a field $k$ is a plane curve $E$ of the form
$$y^2 + a_1xy + a_3y = x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_4 x + a_6,$$
with $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_6 \in k$.

The \textbf{Weierstrass coefficients} of this model $E$ are the five coefficients $a_i$.  These are often displayed as a list $[a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_6]$.

It is common not to distinguish between the \textit{affine} curve defined by a Weierstrass equation and its \textit{projective closure}, which contains exactly one additional \textit{point at infinity}, $[0:1:0]$.

A Weierstrass model is smooth if and only if its \hyperref[ec.discriminant]{discriminant} $\Delta$ is nonzero.  In this case, the plane curve $E$ together with the point at infinity as base point, define an \hyperref[ec]{elliptic curve} defined over $k$.

Two smooth Weierstrass models define isomorphic elliptic curves if and only if they are \hyperref[ec.weierstrass_isomorphism]{isomorphic} as Weierstrass models.
