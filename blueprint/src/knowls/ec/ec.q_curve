\begin{definition*}\label{ec.q_curve}
\uses{ec,ec.base_change,ec.complex_multiplication,ec.isogeny,nf}
An \hyperref[ec]{elliptic curve} $E$ defined over a \hyperref[nf]{number field} $K$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$\textbf{-curve} if it is \hyperref[ec.isogeny]{isogenous} over $\overline{K}$ to each of its Galois conjugates.  Note that the isogenies need not be defined over $K$ itself.

An elliptic curve which is the \hyperref[ec.base_change]{base change} of a curve defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-curve, but not all $\mathbb{Q}$-curves are 
base-change curves. 

Elliptic curves with \hyperref[ec.complex_multiplication]{CM} are all $\mathbb{Q}$-curves, as are all those whose $j$-invariant is in $\mathbb{Q}$.
