The <b>congruent number problem</b> is the problem of determining whether a given
rational number is or is not a \hyperref[ec.congruent_number]{congruent number}.  

Since $n$ is congruent if and only if $nt^2$ is, for any nonzero rational number
$t$, it is sufficient to consider the case where $n$ is a square-free
integer; some sources state the congruent number problem only for positive integers for this reason.

A positive integer $n$ is congruent if and only if there exists a
rational number $a$, such that $a$, $a-n$ and $a+n$ are all squares of
rational numbers.  For, given rational $X,Y,Z$ satisfying $X^2+Y^2=Z^2$ and $XY=2n$,
the rational number $a=(Z/2)^2$ satisfies $a\pm n=((X\pm Y)/2)^2$, and conversely, given $a=A^2$ with $a+n=B^2$ and $a-n=C^2$, set $(X,Y,Z)=(2A,B+C,B-C)$.

For example, with the $3,4,5$ right triangle and $n = 6$, let $a =
25/4=(5/2)^2$; then $a-n=25/4 - 6 = (1/2)^2$ and $a+n=25/4 + 6 =
(7/2)^2$.

It is known that a positive integer number $n$ is congruent if and
only if there exists a rational solution $(x,y)$ with $y\not=0$ to the
\hyperref[ec]{elliptic curve} equation: \[ E_n:\quad y^2 =
x^3 - n^2 x, \] or, in other words, a rational point $P=(x,y)$ on the \hyperref[ec.congruent_number_curve]{congruent number curve} 
$E_n(\Q)$ with $y\not=0$.
