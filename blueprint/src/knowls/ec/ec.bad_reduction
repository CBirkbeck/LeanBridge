\subsection{\href{https://beta.lmfdb.org/knowledge/show/ec.bad_reduction}{Bad reduction of an elliptic curve at a prime}}
\begin{definition*}\label{ec.bad_reduction}
\uses{ec,ec.additive_reduction,ec.discriminant,ec.nonsplit_multiplicative_reduction,ec.split_multiplicative_reduction,nf,nf.prime}
An \hyperref[ec]{elliptic curve} \(E\) defined over a \hyperref[nf]{number field} \(K\) is said to have \textbf{bad reduction} at a \hyperref[nf.prime]{prime} \(\mathfrak{p}\) of \(K\) if the reduction of \(E\) modulo \(\mathfrak{p}\) is singular.
There are three types of bad reduction:

\begin{itemize}
\item  \hyperref[ec.split_multiplicative_reduction]{split multiplicative},
\item  \hyperref[ec.nonsplit_multiplicative_reduction]{non-split multiplicative},
\item  \hyperref[ec.additive_reduction]{additive}.
\end{itemize}

A curve has bad reduction at \(\mathfrak{p}\) if and only if \(\mathfrak{p}\) divides its \hyperref[ec.discriminant]{discriminant}.
\end{definition*}
