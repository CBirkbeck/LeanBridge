If $E$ is an elliptic curve defined over the $p$-adic field $\mathbb{Q}_p,$ its Tamagawa number is the finite index
\[c_p=[E(\mathbb{Q}_p):E^0(\mathbb{Q}_p)].\]
Here $E^0(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ is the subgroup of points which have good reduction. If $E$ has good reduction, then $E(\mathbb{Q}_p)=E^0(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ and $c_p=1$.

An elliptic curve $E$ defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ has a Tamagawa number $c_p$ at every prime $p$, with $c_p=1$ for all primes of good reduction (and hence $c_p=1$ for all but finitely many primes).
\end{definition}
