The \textbf{minimal quadratic twist} of an elliptic curve $E$ defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ is defined as follows.

\begin{itemize}
\item   First consider the finite set of all \hyperref[ec.twists]{quadratic twists}  of $E$ which have minimal \hyperref[ec.q.conductor]{conductor}.  If this set contains just one curve, it is the minimal quadratic twist.
\item   Otherwise, sort the curves with minimal conductor into \hyperref[ec.isogeny_class]{isogeny classes}, and restrict attention to the curves whose class comes first in the LMFDB labelling; equivalently, sort the curves by the sequence of coefficients $(a_n)$ of their $L$-function and restrict to the curve or curves with the first such sequence.
\item  If $E$ does not have \hyperref[ec.complex_multiplication]{Complex Multiplication} (CM), then the minimal isogeny class contains a *unique* curve with the same \hyperref[ec.j_invariant]{$j$-invariant} as $E$, and this curve is the minimal quadratic twist of $E$.
\item  If $E$ does have CM, then the minimal isogeny class contains exactly *two* curves with $j$-invariant $j(E)$.   In all but one case these two curves have distinct minimal discriminants, with the same sign, and we define the minimal quadratic twist to be the curve whose \hyperref[ec.minimal_discriminant]{minimal discriminant} has smallest absolute value.
\item  The exception is for elliptic curves with $j=66^3$, which have CM by the imaginary quadratic \hyperref[nf.order]{order} with discriminant $-16$.  The minimal conductor is $32$, and curves [32.a1](https://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/Q/32/a/1) and [32.a2](https://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/Q/32/a/2) (which are quadratic twists of each other by $-1$) both have minimal  discriminant $2^9$.  The minimal quadratic twist for $j=66^3$ is defined to be [32.a1](https://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/Q/32/a/1).
\end{itemize}


All \hyperref[ec]{elliptic curves} $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ with $j$-invariant $1728$ are \hyperref[ec.twists]{quartic twists} of each other.  The smallest 
\hyperref[ec.q.conductor]{conductor} of such a curve is $32$.   Both the curves 
[32.a3](https://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/Q/32/a/3) and [32.a4](https://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/Q/32/a/4) have $j$-invariant $1728$, and they have minimal discriminants $-2^{12}$ and $2^6$ respectively.  
We define the \textbf{minimal quartic twist} (or just \textbf{minimal twist}) of every elliptic curve with $j=1728$ to be the curve [32.a3](https://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/Q/32/a/3), which has smaller discriminant, and equation $Y^2=X^3-X$.


All \hyperref[ec]{elliptic curves} $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ with $j$-invariant $0$ are \hyperref[ec.twists]{sextic twists} of each other.  The smallest \hyperref[ec.q.conductor]{conductor} of such a curve is $27$.   Both the curves [27.a3](https://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/Q/27/a/3) and [27.a4](https://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/Q/27/a/4) have $j$-invariant $0$, and they have minimal discriminants $-3^9$ and $-3^3$ respectively.  
We define the \textbf{minimal sextic twist} (or just \textbf{minimal twist}) of every elliptic curve with $j=0$ to be the curve [27.a4](https://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/Q/27/a/4), which has smaller discriminant, and equation $Y^2+Y=X^3$.

The \textbf{minimal twist} of an elliptic curve $E$ is its minimal quadratic twist, unless $j(E)=0$ or $1728$, in which cases the minimal twist is its minimal sextic or quartic twist respectively.
The minimal quadratic twist depends only on the $j$-invariant unless $j=0$ or $1728$; in each of  these cases, there are infinitely many different minimal quadratic twists, though only one minimal twist.
