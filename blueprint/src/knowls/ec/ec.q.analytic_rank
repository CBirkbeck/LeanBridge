The \textbf{analytic rank} of an \hyperref[ec]{elliptic curve} $E$ is the analytic rank of its \hyperref[lfunction]{L-function} $L(E,s)$.   The weak form of the BSD conjecture implies that the analytic rank is equal to the rank of the \hyperref[ec.mordell_weil_group]{Mordell-Weil group} of $E$.

For elliptic curves $E$ over $\Q$, it is known that $L(E,s)$ satisfies the Hasse-Weil conjecture, and hence that the parity of the analytic rank is always compatible with the \hyperref[lfunction.sign]{sign} of the \hyperref[lfunction.functional_equation]{functional equation}.

In general, analytic ranks stored in the LMFDB are only upper bounds on the true analytic rank (they could be incorrect if $L(E,s)$ had a zero very close to but not on the \hyperref[lfunction.central_point]{central point}).  For elliptic curves over $\Q$ of analytic rank less than 2 this upper bound is necessarily tight, due to parity; for analytic ranks $2$ and $3$ is also tight due to results of Kolyvagin; Murty and Murty; Bump, Friedberg and    Hoffstein;  Coates and Wiles; Gross and Zagier which together say that when the analytic rank is $0$ or $1$ then it equals the \hyperref[ag.mordell_weil]{Mordell-Weil rank}.
