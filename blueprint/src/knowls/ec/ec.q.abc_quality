\begin{definition}\label{ec.q.abc_quality}
\uses{ec,ec.j_invariant,ec.q.conductor}
Given a triple $a,b,c$ of nonzero coprime integers, the \textbf{quality} of the triple is defined as
$$
Q = \frac{\log \max(|a|, |b|, |c|)}{\log \operatorname{rad}(abc)},
$$
where $\operatorname{rad}(abc)$ is the product of the primes dividing $abc$.  The $abc$ conjecture stipulates that for any $\epsilon > 0$ there are only finitely many relatively prime triples $a,b,c$ with quality larger than $1+\epsilon$.

The \textbf{$abc$ quality} of an \hyperref[ec]{elliptic curve} $E$ is the quality of an $a,b,c$ triple determined by its \hyperref[ec.j_invariant]{$j$-invariant}, namely the one defined by writing $\frac{j}{1728} = \frac{a}{c}$ in lowest terms and setting $b = c - a$.  Note that the $abc$ quality is undefined for $j=0$ and $j=1728$.

The reason for defining the quality of $E$ in this way comes from the equivalence of the $abc$ conjecture with the \hyperref[ec.q.szpiro_ratio]{modified Szpiro conjecture}. For elliptic curves with small \hyperref[ec.q.conductor]{conductor}, $j$-invariants often have unusually large quality.
