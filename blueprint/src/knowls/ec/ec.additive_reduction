\begin{definition}\label{ec.additive_reduction}
\uses{ec,nf}
An \hyperref[ec]{elliptic curve} \(E\) defined over a \hyperref[nf]{number field} \(K\) is said to have \textbf{additive reduction} at a prime \(\mathfrak{p}\) of \(K\) if the reduction of \(E\) modulo \(\mathfrak{p}\) has a cuspidal singularity.
