An \hyperref[ec]{elliptic curve} whose \hyperref[ec.endomorphism_ring]{endomorphism ring} is larger than \(\Z\) is said to have \textbf{complex multiplication} (often abbreviated to CM).  In this case, for curves defined over fields of \hyperref[ring.characteristic]{characteristic} zero, the endomorphism ring is isomorphic to an \hyperref[nf.order]{order} in an imaginary quadratic field.  The discriminant of this order is the \textbf{CM discriminant}.

An elliptic curve whose \hyperref[ec.geom_endomorphism_ring]{geometric endomorphism ring} is larger than \(\Z\) is said to have \textbf{potential complex multiplication} (potential CM).  In the literature, these too are often called CM elliptic curves.

The property of having potential CM depends only on the \hyperref[ec.j_invariant]{$j$-invariant} of the curve.  In characteristic $0$, CM $j$-invariants are algebraic integers, and there are only finitely many in any given number field.  There are precisely 13 CM $j$-invariants in $\Q$ (all integers), associated to the 13 imaginary quadratic orders of \hyperref[nf.class_number]{class number} $1$:

\begin{array}{c|ccccccccccccc}
j & -12288000 & 54000 & 0 & 287496 & 1728 & 16581375 & -3375 & 8000 & -32768 & -884736 & -884736000 & -147197952000 & -262537412640768000\\
\text{CM discriminant} &-27 & -12 & -3 & -16 & -4 & -28 & -7 & -8 & -11 & -19 & -43 & -67 & -163
\end{array}
$$

CM elliptic curves are examples of \hyperref[ag.complex_multiplication]{CM abelian varieties}.
