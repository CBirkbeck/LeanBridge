\begin{definition}\label{ec.tamagawa_number}
\uses{ec,ec.good_reduction,nf}
The \textbf{Tamagawa number} of an \hyperref[ec]{elliptic curve} \(E\) defined over a \hyperref[nf]{number field} at a prime \(\mathfrak{p}\) of \(K\) is the index \([E(K_{\mathfrak{p}}):E^0(K_{\mathfrak{p}})]\), where \(K_{\mathfrak{p}}\) is the completion of \(K\) at \(\mathfrak{p}\) and \(E^0(K_{\mathfrak{p}})\) is the subgroup of \(E(K_{\mathfrak{p}})\) consisting of all points whose reduction modulo \(\mathfrak{p}\) is smooth.

The Tamagawa number of \(E\) at \(\mathfrak{p}\) is usually denoted \(c_{\mathfrak{p}}(E)\).  It is a positive integer, and equal to \(1\) if \(E\) has \hyperref[ec.good_reduction]{good reduction} at  \(\mathfrak{p}\) and may be computed in general using Tate's algorithm.

The product of the Tamagawa numbers over all primes is a positive integer known as the \textbf{Tamagawa product}.
