For each positive integer $n$, the <b>congruent number curve</b> $E_n$ is the \hyperref[ec]{elliptic curve} defined over $\Q$ with \hyperref[ec.weierstrass_coeffs]{equation} $y^2 = x(x^2-n^2)$.
Rational points $(x,y)\in E_n(\Q)$ with $y\not=0$ are associated  to solutions of the \hyperref[ec.congruent_number_problem]{congruent number problem} for $n$:
given rational numbers $X,Y,Z$ satisfying $X^2+Y^2=Z^2$ and $XY=2n$, set $x=\frac{1}{4}Z^2$ and $y=\frac{1}{8}Z(X^2-Y^2)$; then $y^2=x(x^2-n^2)$.

The only rational points of
finite order on $E_n(\Q)$ are the point at infinity (the origin for
the group law) and the three points of order $2$: $(0,0)$, $(\pm
n,0)$; thus, $n$ is congruent if and only if $E_n(\Q)$ is infinite,
that is, if and only if the \hyperref[ec.rank]{rank} of
$E_n(\Q)$ is positive.

For example, the elliptic curve $E_6: y^2 = x^3 - 36x$ has rank $1$,
with \hyperref[ec.mordell_weil_group]{Mordell-Weil group} $E_6(\Q)$ generated (modulo torsion) by $P =
(-3,9)$, and $2P=(25/4,-35/8)$ is the rational point arising from the
$(3,4,5)$-triangle.  In general, only points in $2E_n(\Q)$ come from
solutions to the congruent number problem; these are the rational points $(x,y)$ for which $x$ and $x\pm n$ are all squares.

The \hyperref[ec.q.conductor]{conductor} of $E_n$ is $32n_0^2$ when the square-free part $n_0$ of $n$ is odd, and  $16n_0^2$ when $n_0$ is even.

Each congruent number elliptic curve $E_n$ belongs to an \hyperref[ec.isogeny_class]{isogeny class} of four  isogenous curves, connected by \hyperref[ec.isogeny]{2-isogenies}.  The curves $2$-isogenous to
$E_n=[0,0,0,-n^2,0]$ are $[0,0,0,4n^2,0]$ and $[0,\pm 12n,0,n^2,0]$.
