\subsection{Real period}
\begin{definition}\label{ec.q.real_period}
\uses{ec.q.minimal_weierstrass_equation,ec.weierstrass_coeffs,ec.weierstrass_isomorphism}
For an elliptic curve $E$ defined over $\R$ with period lattice $\Lambda$, the **real period** $\Omega$ is the least positive element of $\Lambda\cap\R$ multiplied by the number of components of $E(\R)$. 

When an elliptic curve is defined by means of a {{ KNOWL('ec.weierstrass_coeffs', 'Weierstrass equation') }}, the period lattice $\Lambda$ is the lattice of periods of the invariant differential $dx/(2y+a_1x+a_3)$.  Different Weierstrass models defining {{ KNOWL('ec.weierstrass_isomorphism', 'isomorphic') }}  curves have period lattices which are **homothetic**, meaning that they differ by a nonzero multiplicative constant.  When we speak of **the** period lattice or **the** real period for an elliptic curve defined over $\Q$, we always mean the lattice and period associated with a {{ KNOWL('ec.q.minimal_weierstrass_equation', 'minimal') }} equation.
