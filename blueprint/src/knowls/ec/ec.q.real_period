\begin{definition}\label{ec.q.real_period}
\uses{ec.q.minimal_weierstrass_equation,ec.weierstrass_coeffs,ec.weierstrass_isomorphism}
For an elliptic curve $E$ defined over $\R$ with period lattice $\Lambda$, the \textbf{real period} $\Omega$ is the least positive element of $\Lambda\cap\R$ multiplied by the number of components of $E(\R)$. 

When an elliptic curve is defined by means of a \hyperref[ec.weierstrass_coeffs]{Weierstrass equation}, the period lattice $\Lambda$ is the lattice of periods of the invariant differential $dx/(2y+a_1x+a_3)$.  Different Weierstrass models defining \hyperref[ec.weierstrass_isomorphism]{isomorphic}  curves have period lattices which are \textbf{homothetic}, meaning that they differ by a nonzero multiplicative constant.  When we speak of \textbf{the} period lattice or \textbf{the} real period for an elliptic curve defined over $\Q$, we always mean the lattice and period associated with a \hyperref[ec.q.minimal_weierstrass_equation]{minimal} equation.
