For $E$ an \hyperref[ec]{elliptic curve} defined over $\C$ by a \hyperref[ec.weierstrass_coeffs]{Weierstrass equation} with coefficients $a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_6$, the \textbf{period lattice} of $E$ is the set $\Lambda$ of periods of the invariant differential $dx/(2y+a_1x+a_3)$, which is a discrete lattice of \hyperref[group.rank]{rank} $2$ in $\C$.   There is an isomorphism (of complex Lie groups) $\C/\Lambda \cong E(\C)$ defined in terms of the Weierstrass $\wp$-function.

For elliptic curves defined over $\R$ (and in particular, for those defined over $\Q$), the period lattice has one of two possible types dependng on the sign of the \hyperref[ec.q.discriminant]{discriminant} $\Delta$ of $E$:

\begin{itemize}
\item  If $\Delta>0$, then $\Lambda$ is *rectangular*, with a $\Z$-basis of the form $\left<x,yi\right>$, where $x$ and $y$ are positive real numbers; in this case, $E(\R)$ has two connected components.
\item  If $\Delta<0$, then $\Lambda$ has a $\Z$-basis of the form $\left<2x,x+yi\right>$, where $x$ and $y$ are positive real numbers; in this case, $E(\R)$ has one connected component.
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{real period}  of $E$ is defined to be $2x$ in each case, so is equal to the smallest positive real period multiplied by the number of real components.

Note that the period lattice depends on the choice of Weierstrass model of $E$; different models have \hyperref[ec.q.real_period]{homothetic} lattices.  For elliptic curves defined over $\Q$, the period lattice associated to a \hyperref[ec.global_minimal_model]{global minimal model} of $E$ is called the \textbf{N\'e;ron lattice} of $E$.  The real period of the N\'e;ron lattice is denoted $\Omega_E$, and appears in the Birch Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for $E$.
