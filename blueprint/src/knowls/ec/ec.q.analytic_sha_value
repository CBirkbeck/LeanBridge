\begin{definition*}\label{ec.q.analytic_sha_value}
\uses{ec,ec.analytic_sha_order,ec.q.bsdconjecture,ec.rank}
For an \hyperref[ec]{elliptic curve} defined over $\Q$ of \hyperref[ec.rank]{rank} $0$ or $1$, the \hyperref[ec.analytic_sha_order]{analytic order of $\Sha$} is known to be rational and can been computed exactly. For curves of rank at least $2$ it is not known to be rational, but in all the cases where it has been computed it is close to a square integer, as predicted by the \hyperref[ec.q.bsdconjecture]{Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer} conjecture; in these cases we display the rounded value.
