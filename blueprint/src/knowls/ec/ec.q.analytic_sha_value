\subsection{Analytic order of Sha (numerical value)}
\begin{definition}\label{ec.q.analytic_sha_value}
\uses{ec,ec.analytic_sha_order,ec.q.bsdconjecture,ec.rank}
For an {{ KNOWL('ec', 'elliptic curve') }} defined over $\Q$ of {{ KNOWL('ec.rank', 'rank') }} $0$ or $1$, the {{ KNOWL('ec.analytic_sha_order', 'analytic order of &#1064;') }} is known to be rational and can been computed exactly. For curves of rank at least $2$ it is not known to be rational, but in all the cases where it has been computed it is close to a square integer, as predicted by the {{KNOWL('ec.q.bsdconjecture', 'Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer')}} conjecture; in these cases we display the rounded value.
\end{definition}
