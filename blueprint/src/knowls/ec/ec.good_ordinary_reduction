\subsection{Good ordinary reduction}
\begin{definition}\label{ec.good_ordinary_reduction}
\uses{ec,nf}
An {{ KNOWL('ec', 'elliptic curve') }} \(E\) defined over a {{ KNOWL('nf', 'number field') }} \(K\) is said to have **ordinary reduction** at a prime \(\mathfrak{p}\) of \(K\) if the reduction \(E_{\mathfrak{p}}\) of \(E\) modulo \(\mathfrak{p}\) is smooth, and \(E_{\mathfrak{p}}\) is ordinary.

An elliptic curve \(E_{\mathfrak{p}}\) defined over a finite field of characteristic \(p\) is **ordinary** if \(E_{\mathfrak{p}}(\overline{\F_p})\) has nontrivial \(p\)-torsion.
\end{definition}
