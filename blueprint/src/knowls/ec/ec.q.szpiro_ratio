\begin{definition}\label{ec.q.szpiro_ratio}
\uses{ec,ec.minimal_discriminant,ec.q.conductor,ec.q.j_invariant}
The (modified) \textbf{Szpiro ratio} of an \hyperref[ec]{elliptic curve} $E$ is defined as
\[
\sigma_m(E) = \frac{\log \max(|c_4|^3, |c_6|^2)}{\log N},
\]
where $N$ is the \hyperref[ec.q.conductor]{conductor} of $E$ and $c_4$ and $c_6$ are defined as for the \hyperref[ec.q.j_invariant]{$j$-invariant}.  The (modified) Szpiro conjecture is that, for any $\epsilon > 0$, there are only finitely many elliptic curves with Szpiro ratio larger than $6+\epsilon$.  In \cite{MR:992208}, Oesterlé proves that this conjecture is equivalent to the \hyperref[ec.q.abc_quality]{$abc$ conjecture}.

In Oesterlé's paper cited above, there is another conjecture, that the ratio
$$
\frac{\log \Delta}{\log N},
$$
also has the property of only taking values larger than $6+\epsilon$ finitely many times (here $\Delta$ is the \hyperref[ec.minimal_discriminant]{minimal discriminant} of $E$).  This conjecture is implied by the modified Szpiro conjecture (and thus the $abc$ conjecture), but it is not currently known to be equivalent.  All of the Szpiro ratios in the LMFDB are computed in terms of $c_4$ and $c_6$ rather than $\Delta$ for this reason.
