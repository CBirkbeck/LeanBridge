The first conference on the LMFDB, Computation, and Number Theory (LuCaNT) took place July 10-14, 2023 at [ICERM](https://icerm.brown.edu/events/sc-23-lucant/) in Providence, Rhode Island, USA.

This was a one week conference broadly focused on the topics of the
LMFDB, mathematical databases, computation, number theory, and
arithmetic geometry.  The conference included invited talks,
presentations by authors of papers submitted to the conference and
selected by the scientific committee following peer-review, 5-minute lightening talks, software demos, and panel discussions, as well as
time set aside for research and collaboration.

A  proceedings volume  including all of the accepted papers will be published in 2023
 by the AMS in an open access volume of the Contemporary Mathematics series.

Organizers: John Cremona, John Jones, Jennifer Paulhus, Andrew Sutherland, and John Voight.
