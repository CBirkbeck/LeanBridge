\subsection{Ideal class group of a number field}
\begin{definition}\label{nf.ideal_class_group}
\uses{nf,nf.ring_of_integers,ring.fractional_ideal,ring.principal_fractional_ideal}
The **ideal class group** of a {{ KNOWL('nf', "number field") }} $K$ with {{ KNOWL('nf.ring_of_integers', "ring of integers") }} $O_K$ is the group of equivalence classes of ideals, given by the quotient of the multiplicative group of all {{KNOWL('ring.fractional_ideal', 'fractional ideals')}} of $O_K$ by the subgroup of {{KNOWL('ring.principal_fractional_ideal', 'principal fractional ideals')}}.  

Since $K$ is a {{ KNOWL('nf', "number field") }}, the ideal class group of $K$ is a finite abelian group, and so has the structure of a product of cyclic groups encoded by a finite list $[a_1,\dots,a_n]$, where the $a_i$ are positive integers with $a_i\mid a_{i+1}$ for $1\le i<n$.
