\subsection{Defining polynomial}
\begin{definition}\label{cmf.defining_polynomial}
\uses{cmf.coefficient_field,nf}
The {{ KNOWL('cmf.coefficient_field', 'coefficient field of a modular form') }} is a {{ KNOWL('nf', 'number field') }}. A **defining polynomial** for this number field is explicitly recorded, because some of the data associated to the modular form will be expressed in terms of roots of this polynomial.
\end{definition}
