\subsection{Reliability of global number field data}
\begin{definition}\label{rcs.rigor.nf}
\uses{}
Global number field data was computed without heuristics or conjectures with the exception of certain class numbers, class groups, and generators for unit groups where, in some cases, the generalized Riemann hypothesis was used.  In cases where GRH was used, the data is marked accordingly.
\end{definition}
