\uses{}
The imaginary part of each zero is recorded with an absolute precision of $\pm 2^{-102}$ and the completeness of the list was checked using a rigorous version of Turing's method; see \cite{MR:3315519,doi:10.1090/S0025-5718-2014-02884-6} for further details.

The results have been checked to a separate list of zeros independently computed by Jan B\"uthe to an accuracy of $\pm 2^{-64}$ (this comparison found 108 minor discrepancies, each of which was resolved in favor of the data presented here).
