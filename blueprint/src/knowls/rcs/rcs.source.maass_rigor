\uses{}
Rigorous Maass forms were computed by Kieran Child, Andrei Seymour-Howell, and David Lowry-Duda. The algorithms are based on ideas of Stark \cite{MR0803370} and Hejhal \cite{MR1106989} and described further in \cite{arXiv:2204.11761} and \cite{MR4493409}.

Heuristic Maass forms were computed by Fredrik Str√∂mberg,
Stefan Lemurell, Holger Then, and David Farmer.  Details can be found in \cite{MR2429890}, \cite{MR2895234}, \cite{MR2164106}, and \cite{arXiv:math/0506102}.
