The classical modular form database currently contains information for all \hyperref[cmf.newform]{newforms} $f\in S_k^\mathrm{new}(N,\chi)$ of \hyperref[cmf.level]{level} $N\ge 1$, \hyperref[cmf.weight]{weight} $k\ge 1$, \hyperref[cmf.character]{character} $\chi\colon (\Z/N\Z)^\times\to \C$,
for which any of the following hold:

\begin{itemize}
\item  $Nk^2\le 4000$;
\item  $\chi$ trivial and $Nk^2\le 40\,000$;
\item  $N \le 24$ and $Nk^2 \le 40\,000$;
\item  $N \le 10$ and $Nk^2 \le 100\,000$;
\item  $N \le 100$ and $k \le 12$;
\item  $k > 1$ and $\dim S_k^{\rm new}(N,\chi) \le 100$ and $Nk^2 \le 40\,000$.
\item  $k = 2$, $\chi$ is trivial, and $N\le 50\,000$ or $N \le 10^6$ is prime.
\end{itemize}

In addition to the \hyperref[cmf.newspace]{newspaces} identified above, there are 131 newspaces that are present because they contain the \hyperref[cmf.minimal_twist]{minimal twist} of a newform in one of the newspaces above.

For each newform with \hyperref[cmf.q-expansion]{q-expansion} $f=\sum a_nq^n$ the database contains the integers $\mathrm{tr}(a_n)$ for $1\le n \le 1000$, and when the level is at most $10\,000$ and the \hyperref[cmf.dimension]{dimension} of $f$ is at most $20$, the algebraic integers $a_n$ for $1\le n \le 1000$ expressed in terms of an explicit basis for the \hyperref[cmf.coefficient_ring]{coefficient ring} $\Q(f)$.  For $1000 < N \le 4000$ this data is available for all $n\le 2000$, and for $4000 < N\le 10\,000$, for all $n\le 3000$  (these values exceed both the \hyperref[cmf.sturm_bound]{Sturm bound} and $30\sqrt{N}$ in every case). When the level is at most $10\,000$ and the dimension of $f$ is at most $20$ \hyperref[cmf.heckecharpolys]{Hecke characteristic polynomials} for primes $p\le 100$ are also available.

For each newform $f$ of level $N\le 10\,000$ and each \hyperref[cmf.embedding]{embedding} $\rho\colon \Q(f)\to \C$ the complex numbers $\rho(a_n)$ are available as floating point numbers with a precision of at least $52$ bits (separately, for both real and imaginary parts); this information is available for all newforms, regardless of their dimension, even when algebraic $a_n$ are not available (for the same ranges of $n$ as above).

Dimension tables are available for all newspaces $S_k^\mathrm{new}(N,\chi)$ with $Nk^2 \le 4000$, and also for those with $k>1$ and $Nk^2\le 40\,000$, and those with $N\le 10$ and $Nk^2\le 100\,000$.  For newspaces in these ranges with $N\le 4000$ we have also computed the first $1000$ coefficients of the \hyperref[cmf.trace_form]{trace form} of the newspace.

Not every invariant of every newform has been computed (this is computationally infeasible).  Below is completeness information for some specific invariants:

\begin{itemize}
\item  The following information is available for every newform of level $N\le 10\,000$: \hyperref[cmf.level]{level}, \hyperref[cmf.weight]{weight}, \hyperref[cmf.character]{character}, \hyperref[cmf.dimension]{dimension}, \hyperref[cmf.analytic_conductor]{analytic conductor}, \hyperref[cmf.sato_tate]{Sato-Tate group}, \hyperref[cmf.trace_form]{trace form}, \hyperref[cmf.embedding]{complex embedding} data, all \hyperref[cmf.self_twist]{self twists}, all \hyperref[cmf.inner_twist]{inner twists}, all \hyperref[cmf.twist]{twists} to other newforms in the database, the \hyperref[cmf.minimal_twist]{minimal twist}, and an upper bound on the \hyperref[cmf.analytic_rank]{analytic rank}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item  The following information is available for every newform of dimension at most $20$ and level $N\le 10000$, and also for every weight one newform: \hyperref[cmf.coefficient_field]{coefficient field}, exact algebraic coefficient data, generators for the \hyperref[cmf.coefficient_ring]{coefficient ring}, and a lower bound on the index of the coefficient ring in the ring of integers of the coefficient field.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item  The following information is available for every weight one newform: \hyperref[cmf.projective_image]{projective image} and \hyperref[cmf.projective_image]{projective field}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item  In cases where the odd 2-dimensional \hyperref[artin]{Artin representation} corresponding to a weight one newform is present in the LMFDB, it is listed as a related object and the \hyperref[cmf.artin_image]{Artin image} and \hyperref[cmf.artin_field]{Artin field} of the weight one newform are available, and this information is also available in some cases where a twist of a weight one newform has a corresponding Artin representation in the LMFDB, even though the twisted Artin representation is not in the LMFDB.  As of January 2020 this applies to about 30% of the weight one newforms in the database.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item  The database includes all of the 43 newforms that can be expressed as \hyperref[cmf.eta_quotient]{eta quotients} \cite{doi:10.1090/S0002-9947-96-01743-6,mr:1376550}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item  \hyperref[cmf.stark_unit]{Stark units} for $b=1$ are available for weight 1 newforms of dimension 1.
\end{itemize}
