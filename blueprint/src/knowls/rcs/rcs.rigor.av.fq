\subsection{Reliability of Weil polynomial data}
\begin{definition}\label{rcs.rigor.av.fq}
\uses{ag.curve.genus,ag.jacobian,av.isogeny_class}
Except where noted below, all Weil polynomial data has been computed using rigorous algorithms that do not depend on any unproven assumptions or conjectures:

 * Angle ranks have been computed numerically using 500 bits of precision and \cite{href{https//pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/}{Pari/GP}}'s lindep function.

We have also performed the following consistency check intended to catch any errors in the software used to compute the data, or any errors that might have been introduced during post-processing:

 * We have computed the {{KNOWL('ag.jacobian', 'Jacobians')}} of all {{KNOWL('ag.curve.genus', 'genus')}} 1 and 2 curves for $q$ in the range of our data and confirmed that they agree with the list of {{KNOWL('av.isogeny_class', 'isogeny classes')}} determined to contain Jacobians.
