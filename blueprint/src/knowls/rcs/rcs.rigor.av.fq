Except where noted below, all Weil polynomial data has been computed using rigorous algorithms that do not depend on any unproven assumptions or conjectures:

\begin{itemize}
\item  Angle ranks have been computed numerically using 500 bits of precision and \cite{href{https//pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/}{Pari/GP}}'s lindep function.
\end{itemize}

We have also performed the following consistency check intended to catch any errors in the software used to compute the data, or any errors that might have been introduced during post-processing:

\begin{itemize}
\item  We have computed the \hyperref[ag.jacobian]{Jacobians} of all \hyperref[ag.curve.genus]{genus} 1 and 2 curves for $q$ in the range of our data and confirmed that they agree with the list of \hyperref[av.isogeny_class]{isogeny classes} determined to contain Jacobians.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition*}
