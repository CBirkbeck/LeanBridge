\begin{definition*}\label{rcs.cande.maass_rigor}
\uses{mf.maass.mwf,mf.maass.mwf.character,mf.maass.mwf.eigenvalue,mf.maass.mwf.level,mf.maass.mwf.weight}
The database currently contains data for cuspidal \hyperref[mf.maass.mwf]{Maass newforms} on $\Gamma_0(N)$ of \hyperref[mf.maass.mwf.weight]{weight} 0 with trivial \hyperref[mf.maass.mwf.character]{character} and \hyperref[mf.maass.mwf.eigenvalue]{Laplace eigenvalue} $\lambda = \frac14 + R^2$ with \hyperref[mf.maass.mwf.level]{level} $N$ in the range $1 \leq N \leq 105$, and where $N$ is squarefree.

For each of these levels, the database contains consecutive Maass forms and is complete in the given ranges.

Each database entry corresponds to exactly one Maass form. As each piece of data associated to each of these Maass forms is conjecturally transcendental, it's not possible to give an *exact* Maass form. Each database entry indicates error intervals that contain the associated data for exactly one Maass form.
