\subsection{Completeness of elliptic curve data over $\Q$}
\begin{definition}\label{rcs.cande.ec.q}
\uses{ec.q.conductor}
The database of elliptic curves over $\Q$ consists of the following sets of curves:

- all curves of {{KNOWL('ec.q.conductor', 'conductor')}} less than $500{,}000$;
- all curves whose conductor is $7$-smooth (that is, only divisible by primes $p\le 7$);
- all curves of prime conductor $p \le 300{,}000{,}000$.
