\begin{definition}\label{rcs.rigor.lfunction.lcalc}
\uses{lfunction.zeros}
Dynamically computed L-functions are computed on-the-fly at low precision and are meant only to indicate the general shape of the L-function.  Information that cannot be computed quickly may be missing (possibly including \hyperref[lfunction.zeros]{zeros}).

The displayed data may be inaccurate, and in particular may not have the accuracy suggested by the displayed precision.
\end{definition}
