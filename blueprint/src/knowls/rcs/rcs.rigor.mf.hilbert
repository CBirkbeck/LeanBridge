\begin{definition}\label{rcs.rigor.mf.hilbert}
\uses{mf.base_change,mf.cm,ring.prime_ideal}
All Hilbert modular form eigenform data has been computed using rigorous algorithms.

\begin{itemize}
\item  When ``is \hyperref[mf.base_change]{base change}'' says \textit{no}, we have certified that the form is not a base change; when \textit{yes}, there is strong evidence of a base change (Hecke eigenvalues seem to match their conjugates under a nontrivial subgroup of automorphisms) but this has not been rigorously established.
\item  When ``is \hyperref[mf.cm]{cm}'' says \textit{no}, we have certified that the form is not a CM form; when \textit{yes}, there is strong evidence that the form has complex multiplication (the form seems to match its twist by a CM character) but this has not been rigorously established.
\end{itemize}

Wherever possible (specifically, when there is a \hyperref[ring.prime_ideal]{prime} $\mathfrak{p} \parallel \mathfrak{N}$ exactly dividing the level), we computed the forms using both definite and indefinite algorithms (see the description in Donnelly-Voight \cite{arxiv:1605.02637}) and got the same answer.
\end{definition}
