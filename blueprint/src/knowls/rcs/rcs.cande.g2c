\begin{definition}\label{rcs.cande.g2c}
\uses{g2c.discriminant}
The database contains all genus 2 curves over $\Q$ that can defined by an integral equation of the form
\[
y^2+(h_3x^3+h_2x^2+h_1x+h_0)y=f_6x^6+f_5x^5+f_4x^4+f_3x^3+f_2x^2+f_1x+f_0,
\]
with $h_i\in\{0,1\}$ and $|f_i|\le 90$ and \hyperref[g2c.discriminant]{absolute discriminant} $|\Delta|\le 10^6$.  As explained in \cite{MR:3540958,arXiv:1602.03715}, it also includes all genus 2 curves of absolute discriminant $|\Delta|\le 10^6$ defined by an integral equation as above such that at least one of the following holds:

\begin{itemize}
\item  $h_i\in \{0,1\}$ and $|f_i|\le 2 (3.51)^{6-i}$ for $0\le i\le 6$;
\item  $h_i\in\{0,1\}$ and $|f_i|\le (7.13)^{4-|i-3|}$ for $0\le i\le 6$;
\item  $h_i\in\{0,1\}$ and $\sum_{i=0}^6 \lceil \log_{10}(|f_i|+1)\rceil\le 10$.
\end{itemize}

To date all known genus 2 curves of absolute discriminant $|\Delta|\le 10^6$ have an integral model that satisfies these constraints, but it is heuristically likely that there exist curves that do not.
