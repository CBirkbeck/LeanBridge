\uses{av.fq.honda_tate,av.fq.weil_polynomial}
The computation is based of the \hyperref[av.fq.honda_tate]{Honda-Tate theorem} which states that isogeny classes of abelian varieties over finite fields are completely determined by the characteristic polynomial of their Frobenius automorphism acting on the first $\ell$-adic cohomology group. For a given dimension $g$ and base field of size $q$, a complete list of all \hyperref[av.fq.weil_polynomial]{Weil polynomials} that do occur can be enumerated using a technique developed by Kedlaya \cite{mr:2459990,arxiv:math/0608104}. In 2016, Dupuy, Kedlaya, Roe, and Vincent improved upon Kedlaya's original code to generate these tables and the data they contain \cite{arXiv:2003.05380}.

See also the article of Kedlaya and Sutherland \cite{mr:3540942,arxiv:1511.06945}, where these techniques are used to compute Weil polynomials for K3 surfaces. 

The determination of which isogeny classes contain Jacobians includes the constraint that if $X$ is a curve over $\F_q$, then the number of degree-$n$ places of $X$ is nonnegative for all positive integers $n$; together with additional constraints from: Howe and Lauter, New methods for bounding the number of points on curves over finite fields \cite{MR2987661, arXiv:1202.6308, doi:10.4171/119-1/12}. This incorporates prior results from the following papers.

The list of curves with Jacobian in a given isogeny class were computed by:

\begin{itemize}
\item  Andrew Sutherland (dimensions $2$ and $3$ except as otherwise indicated);
\item  Everett Howe (hyperelliptics in dimensions $3$, $4$, and $5$ over $\F_q$ with $q$ odd; \cite{arXiv:2401.15255});
\item  Xavier Xarles (dimension $4$ over $\F_2$; \cite{arXiv:2007.07822});
\item  Kiran Kedlaya (hyperelliptics in dimensions $3$ and $4$ over $\F_q$ with $q>2$ even, using the method of Xarles);
\item  Jonas Bergström, Carel Faber, and Sam Payne (dimension $4$ over $\F_3$; \cite{arXiv:2206.07759}); 
\item  Dusan Dragutinović (dimension $5$ over $\F_2$; \cite{arXiv:2202.07809});
\item  Steve Huang, Kiran Kedlaya and Jun Bo Lau (dimension $6$ over $\F_2$; \cite{arXiv:2402.00716}).
