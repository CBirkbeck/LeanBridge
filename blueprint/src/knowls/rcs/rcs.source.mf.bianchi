The database of \hyperref[mf.bianchi]{Bianchi modular forms} was mostly computed by John Cremona using modular symbol algorithms developed in his [1981 DPhil thesis](http://http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/theses/JCthesis-scan.pdf) (see also [J. E. Cremona,
Hyperbolic tessellations, modular symbols, and
elliptic curves over complex quadratic fields
Compositio Mathematica, tome 51, no 3 (1984), p. 275-324](http://http://www.numdam.org/article/CM\_1984\_\_51\_3\_275\_0.pdf)) for the five fields $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-1})$,  $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-2})$, $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$, $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-7})$, and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-11})$.  This algorithm was extended to handle the other four fields of \hyperref[nf.class_number]{class number} one ($\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-19})$, $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-43})$, $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-67})$, $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-163})$) by Elise Whitley in her  [1990 PhD thesis](http://hdl.handle.net/10871/8427), to $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-5})$ by Jeremy Bygott in his [1999 PhD thesis](http://hdl.handle.net/10871/8322), and to the fields $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-23})$ and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-31})$ of class number $3$ by Mark Lingham in his [2005 PhD thesis](http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/10138/). These extended algorithms were reimplemented by John Cremona in 2021-2022. The open source code <tt>bianchi-progs</tt> implementing the algorithm in C++ is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/JohnCremona/bianchi-progs); it depends on the C++ library [eclib](https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib).  The code is currently (as of December 2022) limited to the fields of \hyperref[nf.abs_discriminant]{absolute discriminant} less than \(100\) or equal to \(163\), so includes the nine imaginary quadratic fields of class number one, and a number of fields of class number up to $8$. It only computes newforms data for forms of \hyperref[mf.bianchi]{cuspidal} \hyperref[mf.bianchi.weight]{weight} \(2\)  with trivial character and \hyperref[mf.bianchi.newform]{dimension} \(1\).

<!--- Forms of dimension 2 over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-1})$ were computed by Ciaran Schembri using the [Magma package](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/handbook/modular\_forms\_over\_imaginary\_quadratic\_fields/) written by Dan Yasaki. --->

Dimension data for full cuspidal and new spaces for a range of weights and $\mathrm{SL}_2$ levels over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-d})$ for $d=2,11,19,43,67,163$ were computed by Alexander Rahm using [his own code](https://gaati.org/rahm/MathematicalSoftware.htm) written in PARI/GP.
