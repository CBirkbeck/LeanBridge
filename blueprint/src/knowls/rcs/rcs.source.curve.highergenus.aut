A paper with a detailed description of the data may be found at \cite{href{http://www.math.grinnell.edu/~paulhusj/Paulhus-lmfdb.pdf}{ www.math.grinnell.edu/~paulhusj/Paulhus-lmfdb.pdf}}.

### Original Data of Thomas Breuer

The basis for this data is the work of Thomas Breuer \cite{MR1796706} to classify all group actions on \hyperref[ag.riemann_surface]{Riemann surfaces}.  Breuer wrote code to implement his algorithm, and ran that code in GAP up to genus 48.  Using his data, and a slightly modified version of his code in Magma, given a group and a \hyperref[curve.highergenus.aut.signature]{signature}, we compute \hyperref[curve.highergenus.aut.generatingvector]{generating vectors} for each list of conjugacy classes in the group  which correspond to the data in the signature. 

### Full Automorphism Groups

An algorithm written by Jennifer Paulhus, based on work of John F. X. Ries \cite{MR1097170}, then determines whether the action (given as a generating vector) is the full action for that family in the moduli space. If not, the larger group which is the full automorphism group for a generic curve in the family is also computed.  The code may be found at \cite{href{http://github.com/jenpaulhus/group-actions-RS}{github.com/jenpaulhus/group-actions-RS}}.

### Additional Data

\textbf{\hyperref[ag.jacobian]{Jacobian variety} decomposition} These decompositions, using the group action, are based on work described in \cite{MR:2403651,arXiv:math/0312284}, and code found at \cite{href{http://github.com/jenpaulhus/decompose-jacobians}{github.com/jenpaulhus/decompose-jacobians}}. The factors are notated with either an $E$ for an elliptic curve, or an $A_d$ for an abelian variety of dimension $d$. 


\textbf{Corresponding Character(s)} This entry is a list of positive integers (one for each factor in the \hyperref[ag.jacobian]{Jacobian variety} decomposition) enumerating  irreducible $\mathbb{C}$-characters from the character table of the group (as listed in Magma).   Each factor in the Jacobian variety decomposition corresponds to a particular irreducible $\mathbb{Q}$-character of the group, so these numbers each represent an irreducible $\mathbb{C}$-character whose Galois orbit is the corresponding $\mathbb{Q}$-character for that factor. A word of caution: the numbers in Magma may vary depending on how the group is represented.  The numbers in this entry are for the permutation group generated by the listed \hyperref[curve.highergenus.aut.generatingvector]{generating vectors}.

\textbf{Dimension of the corresponding  \hyperref[ag.shimura_variety]{Shimura variety}} For their paper \cite{MR3455876},  Paola Frediani, Alessandro Ghigi, and Matteo Penegini wrote code which computes this dimension.  That code may be found at \cite{\href{http://www.dima.unige.it/~penegini/publications/PossGruppigFix_v2Hwr.m}{www.dima.unige.it/~penegini/publications/PossGruppigFix\_v2Hwr.m}}.


\textbf{Hyperelliptic or Cyclic Trigonal Curves} Whether an action defines a hyperelliptic curve or a cyclic trigonal curve is determined using code written by David Swinarski \cite{\href{http://faculty.fordham.edu/dswinarski/RiemannSurfaceAutomorphisms/}{faculty.fordham.edu/dswinarski/RiemannSurfaceAutomorphisms/}} which is described in his paper \cite{arXiv:1607.04778}.

\textbf{Equations} Equations of hyperelliptic curves are from \cite{MR2035219}.  Equations for all genus 3 curves with automorphisms come from \cite{MR1954371}.  And equations for curves with large automorphisms (i.e. greater than 4(g-1) ) are found in \cite{\href{http://faculty.fordham.edu/dswinarski/RiemannSurfaceAutomorphisms/}{faculty.fordham.edu/dswinarski/RiemannSurfaceAutomorphisms/}}.
