All data in the Sato-Tate group database was computed using rigorous algorithms that do not depend on any unproved hypotheses.

The completeness of the list of 52 \hyperref[st_group.rational]{rational} Sato-Tate groups of \hyperref[st_group.weight]{weight} 1 and \hyperref[st_group.degree]{degree} 4 in the database is the main theorem of \cite{arXiv:1110.6638,doi:10.1112/S0010437X12000279,MR:2982436}.  As noted in this paper, there are 3 additional subgroups of $\mathrm{USp}(4)$ that satisfy the Sato-Tate axioms in weight 1 but do not arise as Sato--Tate groups of abelian surfaces; these are not included in the database.
