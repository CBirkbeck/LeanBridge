\begin{definition}\label{gl2.profinite}
\uses{}
A \textbf{profinite group} is a compact totally disconnected topological group.  Equivalently, it is the inverse limit of a system of finite groups equipped with the discrete topology.

For example, if we take the finite groups $\GL_2(\Z/n\Z)$ as $n$ varies over positive integers, order them by divisibility of $n$ and consider the inverse system equipped with reduction maps $\GL_2(\Z/n\Z)\to \GL_2(\Z/m\Z)$ for all positive integers $m|n$, then the inverse limit
$$
\lim_{\overset{\longleftarrow}{n}} \GL_2(\Z/n\Z) \simeq \GL_2(\widehat{\Z})
$$
is a profinite group which is isomorphic to the group of invertible $2\times 2$ matrices over the topological ring $\widehat{\Z}$, which is the inverse limit of the finite rings $\Z/n\Z$ equipped with the discrete topology.
