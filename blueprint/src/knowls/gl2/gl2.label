Let $H$ be an \hyperref[gl2.open]{open subgroup} of $\GL_2(\widehat{\Z})$ for which $\det(H)=\widehat{\Z}^\times$.  The \textbf{RSZB label} of $H$ has the form $\texttt{N.i.g.n}$, where

\begin{itemize}
\item  $N$ is the \hyperref[gl2.level]{level} of $H$,
\item  $i$ is the \hyperref[gl2.index]{index} of $H$,
\item  $g$ is the \hyperref[gl2.genus]{genus} of $H$, and
\item  $n$ is a positive integer that distinguishes nonconjugate subgroups of the same level, index, and genus.
\end{itemize}

The positive integer $n$ is defined by ordering the subgroups of $\GL_2(\Z/n\Z)$ as described in Section 2.4 of \cite{arxiv:2106.11141}.

When $\det(H)\ne \widehat{\Z}^\times$ the \textbf{RSZB label} of $H$ has the form $\texttt{M.d.m-N.i.g.n}$, where $\texttt{M.d.m}$ identifies the open subgroup $\det(H)\le \GL_1(\widehat{\Z})$ in terms of its level $M$, index $d$, and a positive integer $m$ that is defined by ordering the open subgroups of $\GL_1(\widehat{\Z})$ via the lexicographic ordering of the Conrey labels in the corresponding group of Dirichlet characters of modulus $M$.  In this case the index $i$ is taken relative to the inverse image of $\det(H)$ in $\GL_2(\widehat{\Z})$.

This convention is also used to label open subgroups of $\GL_2(\Z_\ell)$ and arbitrary subgroups of $\GL_2(\Z/n\Z)$ by using the label of the inverse image of $H$ in $\GL_2(\widehat{\Z})$.
