\begin{definition*}\label{gl2.level}
\uses{gl2.open}
The \textbf{level} of an \hyperref[gl2.open]{open subgroup} $H$ of a matrix group $G$ over $\widehat{\Z}$ is the least positive integer $N$ for which $H$ is equal to the inverse image of its projection to the reduction of $G$ modulo $N$.

This also applies to open subgroups of matrix groups over $\Z_\ell$, in which case the level is necessarily a power of $\ell$.
