\subsection{Initial coefficients of the L-polynomial}
\begin{definition}\label{av.fq.initial_coefficients}
\uses{av.fq.l-polynomial,av.isogeny_class}
The LMFDB allows one to search for {{ KNOWL('av.isogeny_class', 'isogeny classes of abelian varieties') }} over finite fields by specifying the first few coefficients of the {{ KNOWL('av.fq.l-polynomial', 'L-polynomial') }} of the isogeny class. The coefficients are ordered in increasing order of the degree of the term, and the initial coefficients **do not include** the leading constant term 1.
\end{definition}
