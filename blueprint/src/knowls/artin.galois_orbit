\subsection{Galois orbit of an Artin representation}
\begin{definition}\label{artin.galois_orbit}
\uses{artin,group.galois.absolute}
The {{KNOWL('group.galois.absolute', 'absolute Galois group')}} $\Gal(\overline\Q/\Q)$ acts on the set of {{ KNOWL('artin', 'Artin representations') }} for an extension by pre-composition, so we consider two representations to be Galois conjugate if they differ by such an automorphism.  The action, for a given representation, in fact factors through a finite degree abelian extension.

The **Galois orbit** of a representation is its orbit under this action.
\end{definition}
