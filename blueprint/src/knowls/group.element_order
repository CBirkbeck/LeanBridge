\subsection{Order of a group element}
\begin{definition}\label{group.element_order}
\uses{alg.binary_operation.identity,group,group.cyclic,group.subgroup}
The **order** of an element $g$ in a multiplicative {{KNOWL('group', 'group')}} $G$ is the least positive integer $n$ such that $g^n$ is the {{KNOWL('alg.binary_operation.identity', 'identity element')}} of $G$, if such an integer exist, and is $\infty$ otherwise.  In an additive group, the order of $g$ is the least positive integer $n$ such that $ng=0$.  In both cases, the order of $g$ is also equal to the cardinality of the {{KNOWL('group.cyclic', 'cyclic')}} {{KNOWL('group.subgroup', 'subgroup')}} it generates.
