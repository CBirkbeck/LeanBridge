\subsection{Abelian variety}
\begin{definition}\label{ag.abelian_variety}
\uses{ag.variety,ec}
An **abelian variety** defined over the field $K$ is a smooth connected projective {{KNOWL("ag.variety", "variety")}} equipped with the structure of an algebraic group. The group law is automatically commutative.

An abelian variety of dimension 1 is the same as an {{ KNOWL('ec', "elliptic curve")}}.
