\subsection{Potential good reduction}
\begin{definition}\label{ag.potential_good_reduction}
\uses{ag.base_change,ag.good_reduction,ag.variety,nf,nf.prime}
A smooth proper {{KNOWL("ag.variety", "variety")}} $X$ over a {{KNOWL("nf", "number field")}} $K$ is said to have **potential good reduction** at a {{KNOWL("nf.prime", "prime")}} $\mathfrak{p}$ if there is a finite extension $L \supset K$ such that the {{KNOWL("ag.base_change", "base change")}} $X_L$ has {{KNOWL("ag.good_reduction", "good reduction")}} at all primes $\mathfrak{q}$ of $L$ above $\mathfrak{p}$.
