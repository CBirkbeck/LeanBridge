\begin{definition}\label{ag.canonical_model}
\uses{ag.curve.genus,ag.hyperelliptic_curve}
The \textbf{canonical map} of a curve $C$ of \hyperref[ag.curve.genus]{genus} $g$ is the map to $\mathbb{P}^{g-1}$ defined by the canonical class.  For \hyperref[ag.hyperelliptic_curve]{non-hyperelliptic} curves of genus larger than 1, this map is an embedding, and its image is a normal curve called the \textbf{canonical model} of $C$.
