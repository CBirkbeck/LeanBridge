\subsection{Irreducible variety}
\begin{definition}\label{ag.irreducible}
\uses{ag.variety}
A {{KNOWL('ag.variety','variety')}} defined over a field $F$ is **irreducible** if it is nonempty and cannot be decomposed as the union of two strictly smaller varieties over $F$. It is **geometrically irreducible** if it remains irreducible when seen as a variety over the {{KNOWL('nf.algebraic_closure', "algebraic closure")}} of $F$.
\end{definition}
