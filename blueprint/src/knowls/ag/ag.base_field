\begin{definition}\label{ag.base_field}
\uses{ag.abelian_variety,ag.minimal_field}
The \textbf{base field}, of an \hyperref[ag.abelian_variety]{algebraic variety} is the field over which it is defined; it necessarily contains the coefficients of a set of defining equations for the variety, but it is not necessarily a \hyperref[ag.minimal_field]{minimal field of definition}.
