\subsection{Base field}
\begin{definition}\label{ag.base_field}
\uses{ag.abelian_variety,ag.minimal_field}
The **base field**, of an {{KNOWL('ag.abelian_variety', 'algebraic variety')}} is the field over which it is defined; it necessarily contains the coefficients of a set of defining equations for the variety, but it is not necessarily a {{KNOWL('ag.minimal_field','minimal field of definition')}}.
