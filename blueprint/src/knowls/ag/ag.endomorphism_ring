\begin{definition*}\label{ag.endomorphism_ring}
\uses{ag.abelian_variety}
An \textbf{endomorphism} of an \hyperref[ag.abelian_variety]{abelian variety} $A$ over a field $k$ is a homomorphism $\varphi \colon A \to A$ defined over $k$.  The set of endomorphisms of an abelian variety $A$ can be given the structure of a ring in which addition is defined pointwise (using the group operation of $A$) and multiplication is composition; this ring is called the \textbf{endomorphism ring} of $A$, denoted $\textrm{End}(A)$.

For endomorphisms defined over an extension of $k$, we instead speak about the \hyperref[ag.geom_endomorphism_ring]{geometric endomorphism ring}.
