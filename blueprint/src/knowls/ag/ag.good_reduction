\begin{definition*}\label{ag.good_reduction}
\uses{ag.abelian_variety,ag.conductor,ag.jacobian,ag.variety,nf,nf.prime}
A smooth proper \hyperref[ag.variety]{variety} $X$ over a \hyperref[nf]{number field} $K$ is said to have \textbf{good reduction} at a \hyperref[nf.prime]{prime} $\mathfrak{p}$ if it has a model over $\mathcal{O}_{K, \mathfrak{p}}$ whose reduction modulo $\mathfrak{p}$ is a smooth variety over the residue field; more precisely, $X$ has good reduction if it is the generic fiber of a smooth proper scheme over $\mathcal{O}_{K, \mathfrak{p}}$.  Otherwise, $\mathfrak{p}$ is said to be a prime of \textbf{bad reduction}.

The set of primes at which a given $X$ has bad reduction is finite.

For an \hyperref[ag.abelian_variety]{abelian variety} $X$, the primes of bad reduction are the primes that divide the \hyperref[ag.conductor]{conductor} of $X$.

If a curve has good reduction at $\mathfrak{p}$, then its \hyperref[ag.jacobian]{Jacobian} does too.  The converse need not hold.
