\subsection{Genus of a smooth curve }
\begin{definition}\label{ag.curve.genus}
\uses{ag.riemann_surface}
The **genus** of a smooth projective geometrically integral curve $C$ defined over a field $k$ is the dimension of the $k$-vector space of regular differentials $H^0(C, \omega_C)$.  When $k=\C$ this coincides with the topological genus of the corresponding {{KNOWL('ag.riemann_surface', "Riemann surface")}}.

The quantity defined above is sometimes also called the **algebraic genus** or the **geometric genus** of $C$. Because of our assumption on the smoothness of $C$, it coincides with the **arithmetic genus** $H^1(C,\mathcal{O}_C)$. 
\end{definition}
