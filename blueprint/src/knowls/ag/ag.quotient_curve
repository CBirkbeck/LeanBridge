\begin{definition*}\label{ag.quotient_curve}
\uses{ag.curve,ag.variety,g2c.aut_grp}
Let $X$ be an \hyperref[ag.curve]{algebraic curve} and let $H$ be a finite subgroup of its \hyperref[g2c.aut_grp]{automorphism group}.

The \textbf{quotient curve} $X/H$ is the algebraic curve obtained by identifying points of $X$ that lie in the same $H$-orbit (equations defining $X/H$ as an \hyperref[ag.variety]{algebraic variety} of dimension one can be constructed from the equations defining $X$ and the automorphisms in $H$).

The natural projection $X\to X/H$ that sends each point on $X$ to its $H$-orbit is a surjective morphism
