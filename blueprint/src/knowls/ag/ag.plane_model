\begin{definition}\label{ag.plane_model}
\uses{}
A \textbf{plane model} of a smooth projective curve $X$ is a closed curve $f(x,y,z)=0$ in $\mathbb{P}^2$ that is birational to $X$.  Such a model is \textbf{singular} if the zero locus of $f$ and its partial derivatives is non-empty, otherwise it is \textbf{smooth}.
