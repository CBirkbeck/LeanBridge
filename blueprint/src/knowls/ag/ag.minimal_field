\begin{definition}\label{ag.minimal_field}
\uses{ag.base_change,ag.curve.genus,ag.variety,ring.field}
Let $V/k$ be an \hyperref[ag.variety]{algebraic variety} defined over a \hyperref[ring.field]{field} $k$ and let $S$ be the set of subfields $k_0\subseteq k$  for which there exists an algebraic variety $V_0/k_0$ whose \hyperref[ag.base_change]{base change} to $k$ is isomorphic to $V$.

Any field $k_0\in S$ that contains no other elements of $S$ is a \textbf{minimal field of definition} for $V$.

In general, an algebraic variety may have more than one minimal field of definition; this does not occur for elliptic curves but it does occur for curves  of \hyperref[ag.curve.genus]{genus} 2.
