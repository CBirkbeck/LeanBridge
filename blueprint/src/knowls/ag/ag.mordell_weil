\subsection{\href{https://beta.lmfdb.org/knowledge/show/ag.mordell_weil}{Mordell-Weil group of an abelian variety}}
\begin{definition}\label{ag.mordell_weil}
\uses{ag.abelian_variety,ag.dimension}
The \textbf{Mordell-Weil group} of an \hyperref[ag.abelian_variety]{abelian variety} $A$ over a \hyperref[nf]{number field} $K$ is its group of $K$-rational points $A(K)$.

Weil, building on Mordell's theorem for elliptic curves over $\Q$, proved that the abelian group $A(K)$ is finitely generated.  Thus
\[
A(K)\simeq \Z^r \oplus T,
\]
where $r$ is a nonnegative integer called the \textbf{Mordell-Weil rank} of $A$, and $T$ is a finite abelian group called the \textbf{torsion subgroup}.

The torsion subgroup $T$ is the product of at most $2g$ cyclic groups, where $g$ is the \hyperref[ag.dimension]{dimension} of $A$.
