\subsection{Embedded model}
\begin{definition}\label{modcurve.embedded_model}
\uses{ag.canonical_model,modcurve}
For hyperelliptic curves and curves of genus less than 2, the {{ KNOWL('ag.canonical_model', 'canonical map') }} is not an embedding.  For {{KNOWL('modcurve', 'modular curves')}} $X_G$ of this form, we take the lowest even weight $k$ so that Riemann-Roch guarantees an embedding into the projectivization of the space of modular forms associated to $G$.  We refer to the image of this embedding as the **embedded model** of $X_G$.
\end{definition}
