The label for an \hyperref[artin]{Artin representation} takes the form A.B.C.DcE where

\begin{itemize}
\item  A is the \hyperref[artin.dimension]{dimension} of the representation;
\item  B is the \hyperref[artin.conductor]{conductor} of the representation, the format for which is explained below;
\item  C is the \hyperref[artin.permutation_container]{smallest permutation representation} for which this representation is a factor.  If the degree is small enough, we give the degree <i>d</i> and \hyperref[gg.tnumber]{t-number} <i>j</i> in the form <code>dtj</code>; otherwise we use just the degree <code>d</code>;
\item  D is an index to distinguish cases where non-Galois conjugate representations have the same dimension, conductor, and smallest permutation representation;
\item  E is an index for the representation within its \hyperref[artin.galois_orbit]{Galois conjugates}.
\end{itemize}
 
The conductor is given in factored form with the following encoding.  Underscores (\_) are to be interpreted as multiplication signs and "e" indicates exponentiation.  So, 2e3\_59 converts to $2^3\cdot 59$.
