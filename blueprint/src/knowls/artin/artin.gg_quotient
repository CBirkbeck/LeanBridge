\subsection{Image of the representation}
\begin{definition}\label{artin.gg_quotient}
\uses{artin,artin.number_field}
An {{ KNOWL('artin', 'Artin representation') }} $\rho:\textrm{Gal}(\overline{\Q}/\Q)\to \GL(V)$ factors through the Galois group of a finite extension of $\Q$. Thus its image is a finite group $G \subset \GL(V)$ which is canonically isomorphic to the Galois group of a finite extension $K/\Q$ where $K$ is the fixed field of $\ker(\rho)$ and is called the {{ KNOWL('artin.number_field', 'Artin field')}} of $\rho$. We sometimes say that $\Gal(K/\Q)$ is the **image of the Artin representation** $\rho$. 
\end{definition}
