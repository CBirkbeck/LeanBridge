\begin{definition}\label{stats.proportions}
\uses{}
When creating a statistics display, you can choose how proportions are computed.  For each box in the resulting display (ie a set of values for the variables), let $N_B$ be the number of objects satisfying the given constraint and in that box.

\begin{itemize}
\item  \textbf{Vs unconstrained}: each entry will show the ratio of $N_B$ out of all objects in the box.
\item  \textbf{By row}: each entry will show the ratio of $N_B$ by the sum of all other $N_{B'}$ in the same row.
\item  \textbf{By column}: each entry will show the ratio of $N_B$ by the sum of all other $N_{B'}$ in the same column.
\item  \textbf{None}: No proportions will be shown.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
