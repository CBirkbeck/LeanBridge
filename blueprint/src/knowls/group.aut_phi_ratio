\subsection{$\phi$-ratio}
\begin{definition}\label{group.aut_phi_ratio}
\uses{group,group.automorphism,group.cyclic}
Given a {{KNOWL('group', 'group')}} $G$ and its {{KNOWL('group.automorphism', 'automorphism')}} group $A$, the $\phi$-ratio is the size of the automorphism group divided by $\phi(G)$ where $\phi$ represents Euler's totient function, that is $$|A|/\phi(G).$$

For {{KNOWL('group.cyclic', 'cyclic')}} groups, the size of their automorphism group is always $\phi(G)$ and hence this ratio is $1$.
\end{definition}
