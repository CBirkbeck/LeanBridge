\begin{definition}\label{gg.galois_group}
\uses{}
The \textbf{Galois group} of an irreducible separable polynomial of degree $n$ can be embedded in $S_n$ through its action on the roots of the polynomial, with the image being well-defined up to labeling of the roots.  Different labelings lead to conjugate subgroups.  The subgroup acts transitively on $\{1,\ldots,n\}$.  Conversely, for every transitive subgroup $G$ of $S_n$ with $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$, there is a field $K$ such that $G$ is the Galois group of some polynomial over $K$.
