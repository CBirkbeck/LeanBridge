\begin{definition}\label{gg.primitive}
\uses{}
Let $G$ be a transitive subgroup of $S_n$.  Then $G$ is \textbf{primitive} if, under the Galois correspondence, it corresponds to a field with no non-trivial proper subfields.

An equivalent group-theoretic condition is as follows.  Let
\[ G_1 = \{\sigma\in G\mid \sigma(1)=1\}.\]
Then $G$ is primitive if and only if $G_1$ is a maximal subgroup of $G$.
\end{definition}
