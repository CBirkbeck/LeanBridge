\begin{definition}\label{hgm.rotation_number}
\uses{hgm.defining_parameters}
If a hypergeometric family has \hyperref[hgm.defining_parameters]{defining parameters} $A=(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$ and $B=(b_1,\ldots,b_m)$, then we can view the parameters as giving two multisets of roots of unity, namely for $A$, the primitive $a_i$-th roots of unity repeated according to their multiplicities in $A$, and similarly for $B$.  These sets has a rotational symmetry group $R$, which may be trivial.  The \textbf{rotation number} is the order of $R$.
\end{definition}
