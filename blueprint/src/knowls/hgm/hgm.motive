\subsection{Hypergeometric motive}
\begin{definition}\label{hgm.motive}
\uses{hgm.familes}
**Hypergeometric motives** $H(A,B,t)$ in a {{ KNOWL('hgm.familes', 'family') }} $H(A,B)$ are
indexed by rational numbers $t \not \in \{0,1\}$, with the case $t=1$ allowed if special attention is given.

For example $H([3],[1,1],t)$ is the
motive $H^1(E_{1728t},{\Bbb Q})$ where
$E_{j}$ is an elliptic curve with $j$-invariant $1728j$.
Also special hypergeometric motives $H(A,B,1)$ are defined, having degree
$1$ or $2$ less than the other $H(A,B,t)$.
