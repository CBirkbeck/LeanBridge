\begin{definition}\label{hgm.monodromy}
\uses{}
The monodromy representation associated to a hypergeometric family is generated by two matrices $A$ and $B$ describing the local monodromy around $\infty$ and $0$, respectively. The presentation used here is due to Levelt \cite{MR0145108}.

The monodromy groups of hypergeometric families of weight 0 were computed by Beukers and Heckman \cite{MR0974906, doi:10.1007/BF01393900}.
