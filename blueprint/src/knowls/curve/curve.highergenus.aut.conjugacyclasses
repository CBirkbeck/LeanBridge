\begin{definition}\label{curve.highergenus.aut.conjugacyclasses}
\uses{group.small_group_label}
Conjugacy classes in a group of automorphisms are identified by their index in the list of conjugacy clases returned by Magma.

For example, the unique conjugacy class in the group $SL(2,3)$ that contains elements of order 4 appears as the 5th conjugacy class in the list of conjugacy classes for this group and is identified by the ordinal $5$. Information about this conjugacy class, including an explicit representative can be obtained in Magma using either of the commands below:

\begin{itemize}
\item  "ConjugacyClasses(SL(2,3))[5];"
\item  "ConjugacyClasses(SmallGroup(24,3))[5];"
\end{itemize}

Here $[24,3]$ is the \hyperref[group.small_group_label]{group identifier} for the group $SL(2,3)$.
