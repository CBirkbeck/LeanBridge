For any integer $g > 1$, the automorphism group of any curve of genus $g$ over $\C$ has order at most $84(g-1)$. This is not best possible for every $g$, but there do exist infinitely many $g$ for which the bound is achieved; examples include  ($g=3$) and the  ($g=7$). See also [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurwitz%27s\_automorphisms\_theorem).
