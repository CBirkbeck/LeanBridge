\begin{definition*}\label{curve.highergenus.aut.groupalgebradecomp}
\uses{ag.endomorphism_ring,av.isogeny,ag.jacobian,g2c.aut_grp}
Given a curve $X$, the group action of the \hyperref[g2c.aut_grp]{automorphism group}  $G=$Aut$(X)$ on $X$ may allow one to decompose its \hyperref[ag.jacobian]{Jacobian} $J$ as a product of abelian varieties of lower dimension. Idempotent relations in the group ring $\mathbb{Q}[G]$ correspond, via  a  natural map of  $\mathbb{Q}$-algebras $\rho:  \mathbb{Q}[G] \to \text{End}(J) \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} \mathbb{Q}$, to
factorizations of the Jacobian variety into abelian varieties that are the images of the Jacobian under the \hyperref[ag.endomorphism_ring]{endomorphisms} determined by those idempotents. The dimensions of the factors in this \textbf{group algebra decomposition} are computed as inner products of certain characters of $G$ (and are thus canonical).

Note: factors in the group algebra decomposition need not be simple (it may be possible to decompose them further), and factors of the same dimension may be \hyperref[av.isogeny]{isogenous}.
