\textbf{Conway polynomials} give a standardized defining polynomial for defining finite fields.  

For the finite field of order $p^n$ where $p$ is prime, we first set an ordering for the elements of $\F_p=\Z/p\Z$, namely $0<1<\cdots< p-1$ where we represent classes modulo $p$ by an integer in $\{0,\ldots, p-1\}$.

For two degree $n$ polynomials over $\F_p$, $f=a_n x^n + \cdots a_0$ and $g=b_n x^n+\cdots b_0$, we say $f<g$ if there exists $j$ such that $a_i=b_i$ for $i>j$ and $(-1)^{n-j} a_j < (-1)^{n-j} b_j$.

Then, the Conway polynomial is the first polynomial $f_{p,n}$ of degree $n$ under this ordering such that

  1. a root of $f_{p,n}$ is primitive, i.e., it has order $p^n-1$ in $\overline{\F}_p$
  2. for every positive divisor $m$ of $n$, 
  $$f_{p,m}(x^{(p^n-1)/(p^m-1)}) \equiv 0 \pmod{f_{p,n}},$$
i.e., the $(p^n-1)/(p^m-1)$th power of a root of $f_{p,n}$ is a root of $f_{p,m}$.
