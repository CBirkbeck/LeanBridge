\uses{group,group.label_complex_group_char,group.label_conjugacy_class,group.representation.character}
The \textbf{complex character table} of a finite \hyperref[group]{group} $G$ is a square tabulation of the value of its irreducible \hyperref[group.representation.character]{complex characters}, which encodes useful information about the group $G$ in a compact way. Each row of the table is labeled by an irreducible character (given by its  \hyperref[group.label_complex_group_char]{label}) and the entries in the row are the values of that character on some representative of the corresponding conjugacy class of $G$ given by its \hyperref[group.label_conjugacy_class]{label} on the columns.
