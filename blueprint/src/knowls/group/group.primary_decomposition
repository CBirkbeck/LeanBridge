\begin{definition}\label{group.primary_decomposition}
\uses{}
Every finite abelian group $G$ is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order, and this decomposition is unique up to reordering.  It is referred to as the \textbf{primary decomposition} of $G$.  
\end{definition}
