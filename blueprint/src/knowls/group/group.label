\begin{definition*}\label{group.label}
\uses{group,group.order,group.subgroup_label}
The \textbf{label} for a \hyperref[group]{group} $G$ has the form $\mathtt{N.i}$, where $\mathtt{N}$ is the \hyperref[group.order]{order} of the group and $\mathtt{i}$ is the small group id that distinguishes groups of the same order (as determined in GAP). If a group is not in GAP Small Groups database, we replace $\mathtt{i}$ with an incrementing letter code, assigning labels to groups as they are added to our database.

Subgroups are \hyperref[group.subgroup_label]{labeled} using the ambient group, index, and an ordering of subgroups up to automorphism and then up to conjugacy with the same  invariants.

\end{definition*}
