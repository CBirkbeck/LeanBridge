\begin{definition}\label{group.symmetric}
\uses{group.almost_simple,group.solvable}
The \textbf{symmetric group} is the group $S_n$ of bijections from $n$ element sets to themselves (called permutations), which is of order $n!$. This group is \hyperref[group.solvable]{solvable} for $n\leq 4$ and \hyperref[group.almost_simple]{almost simple} since $S_n=A_n\rtimes C_2$ for $n\geq 5$.
