Certain properties of groups automatically imply other properties. We briefly explain the connections here.


A \hyperref[group.cyclic]{cyclic group} is always \hyperref[group.abelian]{abelian}  by the way the group operation for cyclic groups is defined. Cyclic groups are also automatically \hyperref[group.z_group]{Z-groups} since all their subgroups (including their Sylow subgroups) are cyclic. 

Since cyclic groups are always abelian, Z-groups are by definition \hyperref[group.a_group]{A-groups}, and similarly \hyperref[group.metacyclic]{metacyclic} groups are \hyperref[group.metabelian]{metabelian} as well.


An abelian group is always \hyperref[group.nilpotent]{nilpotent} since the group is its own \hyperref[group.center]{center} and thus an \hyperref[group.upper_central_series]{upper central series} for the group exists.  In addition, abelian groups are \hyperref[group.a_group]{A-groups}  since all their subgroups (including their Sylow subgroups) are abelian.


Nilpotent groups that are also finite (as is the case for groups in this database) are \hyperref[group.supersolvable]{supersolvable} because the upper central series defining a nilpotent group has abelian subquotients which, in the case of finite groups, may be expanded to a chain with cyclic factors.


Supersolvable groups are \hyperref[group.monomial]{monomial} (see Corollary 3.5 in Chapter 2 of \cite{MR:0655785}).

Monomial groups are also \hyperref[group.solvable]{solvable} by a result of Taketa \cite{MR:1568284}.


Since the definition of a metabelian group ensures the existence of a \hyperref[group.subgroup.normal]{normal} subgroup $N \lhd G$ so that $G/N$ is abelian, metabelian groups also satisfy the definition of solvable via the chain of subgroups $\langle e\rangle \leq N \leq G$.

If all the Sylow subgroups are cyclic, then the group is  metacyclic. Hence Z-groups are metacyclic (see Theorem 9.4.3 in \cite{MR:0103215}).

Nonabelian \hyperref[group.simple]{simple groups} are always \hyperref[group.perfect]{perfect groups} since the \hyperref[group.commutator_subgroup]{commutator subgroup} of a group is a normal subgroup and hence must be the whole group in this case. In addition, nonabelian simple groups are also \hyperref[group.almost_simple]{almost simple} and \hyperref[group.quasisimple]{quasi-simple}.
