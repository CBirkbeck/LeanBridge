\begin{definition}\label{group.subgroup}
\uses{alg.binary_operation,alg.binary_operation.identity,alg.binary_operation.inverse,group}
If $G$ is a \hyperref[group]{group}, a subset $H\subseteq G$ is a \textbf{subgroup} of $G$ if the \hyperref[alg.binary_operation]{binary operation} of $G$ restricts to a \hyperref[alg.binary_operation]{binary operation} on $H$, and $H$ is a group for this induced operation.

Equivalently, the subset $H$ must satisfy the following conditions:

1. for all $a,b\in H$, $a*b\in H$
2. the \hyperref[alg.binary_operation.identity]{identity} of $G$ is an element of $H$
3. for every $a\in H$, the \hyperref[alg.binary_operation.inverse]{inverse} of $a$ in $G$ is also in $H$.
\end{definition}
