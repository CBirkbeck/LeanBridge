\subsection{Complete group}
\begin{definition}\label{group.complete}
\uses{}
A group $G$ is **complete** if one of the following equivalent conditions holds:

- it has trivial center and every automorphism is inner,
- the natural map from $G$ to its inner automorphism group is an isomorphism,
- whenever it is embedded as a normal subgroup of a larger group, it is a direct factor.

For $n \ne 2, 6$, the symmetric group $S_n$ is complete.
\end{definition}
