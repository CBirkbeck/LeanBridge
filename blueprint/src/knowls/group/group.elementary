\subsection{Elementary group}
\begin{definition}\label{group.elementary}
\uses{group,group.cyclic,group.direct_product,group.pgroup,group.representation.character}
A finite {{KNOWL('group', 'group')}} is $p$-**elementary** if it is the {{KNOWL('group.direct_product', 'direct product')}} of a {{KNOWL('group.cyclic', 'cyclic')}} group of order relatively prime to $p$ and a {{KNOWL('group.pgroup', '$p$-group')}}.  Brauer's induction theorem states that any {{KNOWL('group.representation.character', 'character')}} of a finite group $G$ is an integer linear combination of inductions of linear characters from elementary subgroups of $G$ (for different primes $p$ dividing the order of $G$).
