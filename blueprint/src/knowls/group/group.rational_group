\subsection{Rational group}
\begin{definition}\label{group.rational_group}
\uses{group.cyclic,group.representation.character}
A group $G$ is **rational** if all of its {{ KNOWL("group.representation.character", "characters")}} are rational valued. (Equivalently every $g$ and $g^k$ are conjugate for $k$ coprime to $|G|$.) It is an unsolved problem to determine what {{KNOWL("group.cyclic", "cyclic")}} groups of order $p$ can be composition factors of rational groups.

Rational groups are sometimes also known as Q-groups, though some authors reserve that term for a stronger property that every representation of G can be realized over $\mathbb{Q}$. (According to this terminology, $Q_8$ is rational but not a Q-group.)
\end{definition}
