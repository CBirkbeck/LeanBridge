A \hyperref[group]{group} $G$ can always be represented as a \hyperref[group.matrix_group]{matrix group}, but the degree of the matrix group is constrained both by $G$ and the \hyperref[ring]{ring} $R$ from which the matrix entries are drawn.  The \textbf{linear degree} $\operatorname{lin}_R(G)$ is the minimal degree $n$ of a \hyperref[group.representation.faithful]{faithful} \hyperref[group.representation.irrep]{linear representation} $\rho : G \hookrightarrow \GL_n(R)$, and the \textbf{irreducible degree} $\operatorname{irr}_R(G)$ is the minimal degree $n$ of a faithful \hyperref[group.representation.irrep]{irreducible} representation $\rho: G \hookrightarrow \GL_n(R)$.  Note that, while a faithful linear representation always exists, there may be no faithful irreducible representations of $G$ (in which case we conventionally set $\operatorname{irr}_R(G) = -1$).

For fields $R$ of \hyperref[ring.characteristic]{characteristic} 0, these values can be characterized in terms of the \hyperref[group.complex_character_table]{character table} of $G$.  A \hyperref[group.representation.character]{character} $\chi$ of degree $n$ is faithful if the only $g \in G$ with $\chi(g) = n$ is $g=1$.  The value $\operatorname{irr}_{\mathbb{C}}(G)$ can thus be read off of the character table, but computing $\operatorname{lin}_{\mathbb{C}}(G)$ requires finding linear combinations of characters that are faithful.

For fields $k$ that are not algebraically closed, summing over Galois orbits of complex characters yields \hyperref[group.representation.rational_character]{characters with values in $k$}, and the resulting characters will be faithful if and only if each of the summands is.  However, the \hyperref[group.representation.schur_index]{Schur index} now plays a role, since multiple copies of the given $k$-values character may be needed in order to produce an actual representation with matrix entries in $k$.  Both $\operatorname{lin}_R(G)$ and $\operatorname{irr}_R(G)$ are defined in terms of the matrix degree of a representation, which may be larger than the degree of a minimal faithful $k$-valued character.
