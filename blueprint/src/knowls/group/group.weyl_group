\begin{definition}\label{group.weyl_group}
\uses{group.automorphism,group.centralizer,group.subgroup,group.subgroup.index,group.subgroup.normalizer}
The \textbf{Weyl group} associated to a \hyperref[group.subgroup]{subgroup} $H \subseteq G$ is the quotient $W = N_G(H) / Z_G(H)$ of the \hyperref[group.subgroup.normalizer]{normalizer} of $H$ by the \hyperref[group.centralizer]{centralizer} of $H$.  The terminology is taken from the theory of Lie groups, where there is a unique conjugacy class of maximal tori in a Lie group $G$ and if $T$ is any such maximal torus then $Z_G(T) = T$ has finite \hyperref[group.subgroup.index]{index} in $N_G(T)$.  In that context we may thus speak of the Weyl group of $G$.

When $G$ is an abstract group, we must specify $H$ as well, and the Weyl group naturally embeds into the \hyperref[group.automorphism]{automorphism} group $\Aut(H)$ and gives the subset of automorphisms of $H$ that are induced by conjugation within $G$.
