\begin{definition}\label{group.omega}
\uses{group.orthogonal,group.spinor_norm}
The groups $\Omega(n,q)$ and $\Omega^{\pm}(n,q)$ are subgroups of the \hyperref[group.orthogonal]{special orthogonal groups} $\SO(n,q)$ and $\SO^{\pm}(n,q)$. Their specific definitions depend on the properties of $n$ and $q$.

When $n$ is odd, $\Omega(n,q)$ is a subgroup of $\SO(n,q)$. If $q$ is odd, $\Omega(n,q)$ is the kernel of the \hyperref[group.spinor_norm]{spinor norm map} $\SO(n,q) \to (\F_q^\times)/(\F_q^\times)^2$, and is an index $2$ subgroup of $\SO(n,q)$. When $q$ is even, we define $\Omega(n,q) = \SO(n,q)$. 

When $n$ is even, $\Omega^{\pm}(n,q)$ is a subgroup of $\SO^{\pm}(n,q)$. To define it, we use the \textit{quasideterminant} map, sending $g \in \SO(n,q)$ to $(-1)^d$, where $d$ is the dimension of the subspace of $V = \F_q^n$ fixed by $g$. Then $\Omega^{\pm}(n,q)$ is the kernel of this map, i.e. all those $g$ fixing an even-dimensional subspace of $V$. 

The groups $\POmega(n,q)$ are $\POmega^{\pm}(n,q)$ are the quotients of $\Omega(n,q)$ and $\Omega^{\pm}(n,q)$, respectively, by their subgroups of scalar matrices.
