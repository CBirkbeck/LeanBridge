\begin{definition}\label{group.repr_explain}
\uses{group.conjugacy_class,group.permutation_representation,group.presentation,group.solvable}
A representative of each \hyperref[group.conjugacy_class]{conjugacy class} is given in different formats depending on how the abstract group is stored in the database.

For *permutation groups* the representative is given as a permutation of \hyperref[group.permutation_representation]{degree} given in the Construction section of this group's main page.

For *matrix groups* the representatives are given by matrices in the group described in the Construction section of this group's main page.

For \hyperref[group.solvable]{solvable} groups, the representatives are given as words in the generators from the \hyperref[group.presentation]{presentation} given in the Construction section of this group's main page.
