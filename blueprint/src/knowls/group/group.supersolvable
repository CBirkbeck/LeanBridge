\begin{definition*}\label{group.supersolvable}
\uses{group.abelian,group.metacyclic,group.monomial,group.nilpotent,group.solvable,group.subgroup.normal}
A group is \textbf{supersolvable} if there are nested \hyperref[group.subgroup.normal]{normal} subgroups $N_i\lhd G$

$${1}=N_0 < N_1 < N_2 < \ldots < N_k = G$$
with all successive quotients $N_{i+1}/N_i$ cyclic. It is stronger than requiring $N_{i+1}/N_i$ to be abelian (because $N_i \lhd G$), so not all \hyperref[group.solvable]{solvable} groups are supersolvable. The smallest solvable groups that are not supersolvable are $A_4$, $S_4$, SL$_2(\mathbb{F}_3)$ and $C_2\times A_4$. All supersolvable groups are \hyperref[group.monomial]{monomial}, and all \hyperref[group.abelian]{abelian}, \hyperref[group.nilpotent]{nilpotent}, \hyperref[group.metacyclic]{metacyclic} groups, Z-groups and groups of square-free order are supersolvable. Supersolvable groups are closed under subgroups and quotients (but not extensions), and a group is supersolvable if and only if each of its maximal subgroups has prime index.


While every nilpotent group is supersolvable, the converse does not hold as shown by <a href="{{url\_for('abstract.index')}}?nilpotent=no&supersolvable=yes">these examples</a>.  Similarly, <a href="{{url\_for('abstract.index')}}?metacyclic=no&supersolvable=yes">these examples</a> show that not every supersolvable group is metacyclic.
