\begin{definition}\label{group.representation.rational_character}
\uses{group,group.division,group.representation.character}
A \textbf{rational character} of a finite \hyperref[group]{group} $G$ is \hyperref[group.representation.character]{complex character} taking values in $\Q$. Such a character can be obtained by taking the sum of Galois conjugates of an irreducible complex character, and we will refer to these as \textbf{irreducible rational characters} even though they are not irreducible as complex characters.  The irreducible rational characters form a $\Q$-basis for the $\Q$-vector space of rational characters.

Note that the representation corresponding to a rational character may not take values in $\GL_n(\Q)$ even though the character takes values in $\Q$ (the difference between the field of character values and the field in which matrix entries lie is measured by the Schur index).

The value taken by a rational character is constant on each \hyperref[group.division]{rational conjugacy classes}.
