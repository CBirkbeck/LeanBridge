\subsection{Subgroup labels}
\begin{definition}\label{group.subgroup_label}
\uses{group.ambient,group.automorphism,group.computing_subgroup_labels,group.gassmann_equivalence,group.label,group.subgroup,group.subgroup.index}
The full label of a {{KNOWL('group.subgroup', 'subgroup')}} is of the form $\mathtt{N.i.m.a}$ or $\mathtt{N.i.m.a.j}$.  In either case, $\mathtt{N.i}$ is the {{KNOWL('group.label', 'label')}} of the {{KNOWL('group.ambient', 'ambient group')}}, $\mathtt{m}$ is the {{KNOWL('group.subgroup.index', 'index')}} of the subgroup in the ambient group, $\mathtt{a}$ distinguishes subgroups up to {{KNOWL('group.automorphism', 'automorphism')}} and $\mathtt{j}$ distinguishes subgroups up to conjugacy.  Both $\mathtt{a}$ and $\mathtt{j}$ take the form of a sequence of letters followed by an ordinal. The letters are a base 26 (a=0, z=25) encoding of the ordering up to {{KNOWL('group.gassmann_equivalence', 'Gassmann-equivalence')}}, and the integer following distinguishes groups in the same Gassmann class.  (For details on how we label Gassmann classes and order subgroups within a Gassmann class, see {{KNOWL('group.computing_subgroup_labels', 'Computing labels of subgroups')}}.) For some ambient groups, we only compute subgroups up to automorphism (in which case the first form is used, omitting the $\mathtt{j}$.

When the ambient group is clear from context, sometimes the short label $\mathtt{m.a}$ or $\mathtt{m.a.j}$ is used instead.
