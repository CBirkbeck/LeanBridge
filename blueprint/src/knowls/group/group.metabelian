\subsection{Metabelian group}
\begin{definition}\label{group.metabelian}
\uses{group.abelian,group.dihedral,group.generalized_quaternion,group.metacyclic,group.solvable}
A finite group $G$ is **metabelian** if its commutator subgroup is abelian. Equivalently, $G$ is an extension of an abelian group by an abelian group. Metabelian groups are {{ KNOWL("group.solvable", "solvable")}}, and they include all {{ KNOWL("group.abelian", "abelian")}}, {{ KNOWL("group.dihedral", "dihedral")}}, {{ KNOWL("group.generalized_quaternion", "quaternion")}}, {{ KNOWL("group.metacyclic", "metacyclic")}}, extraâ€‹special groups and groups of $p$-rank one. 

Every {{KNOWL('group.metacyclic', 'metacylic')}} group is metabelian, but the converse does not hold, as shown by <a href="{{url_for('abstract.index')}}?metacyclic=no&metabelian=yes">these examples</a>.
