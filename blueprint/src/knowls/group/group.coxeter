A finite \textbf{Coxeter group} is a finite group $G$ which has a group presentation of the form
$$ G = \langle s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n \mid (s_i s_j)^{m_{ij}} = 1 \rangle, $$
where $m_{ii} = 1$ for all $i = 1, \dots, n$, and where $m_{ij} = m_{ji} \geq 2$ for all $i \not = j$. Examples of Coxeter groups include all Euclidean reflection groups (e.g. the \hyperref[group.triangle_group]{triangle group}).

Given a Coxeter group $G$ with the above group presentation, one can define the \textbf{Coxeter graph} of $G$ to be a graph with $n$ vertices, labelled $1$ to $n$, with an edge between vertex $i$ and vertex $j$ if and only if $m_{ij} \geq 3$.  If $m_{ij} \geq 4$, then the edge between $i$ and $j$ is furthermore given a value of $m_{ij}$.

A finite \textbf{irreducible Coxeter group} is a Coxeter group whose Coxeter graph is connected.

All finite irreducible Coxeter groups have been classified - every such group lies in either one of the four families $W(A_n)$, $W(B_n)$, $W(D_n)$, $I_2(n)$, or is one of the six exceptional groups $W(E_6)$, $W(E_7)$, $W(E_8)$, $W(F_4)$, $H_3$, or $H_4$.

\begin{itemize}
\item  $W(A_n)$ is isomorphic to the \hyperref[group.symmetric]{symmetric group} $S_{n+1}$ of order $(n+1)!$.
\item  $W(B_n)$ is a group of \hyperref[group.order]{order} $2^n n!$, whose group structure can be written as a \hyperref[group.wreath_product]{wreath product} $C_2 \wr S_n$.
\item  $W(D_n)$ is a group of order $2^{n-1} n!$, whose group structure can be written as $C_2^{n-1} . S_n$.
\item  $I_2(n)$ is isomorphic to the \hyperref[group.dihedral]{dihedral group} $D_n$ of order $2n$.
\end{itemize}


Every finite Coxeter group is a \hyperref[group.direct_product]{direct product} of finite irreducible Coxeter groups.  In the LMFDB, we use the notation $W( \_ )$ to denote irreducible Coxeter groups which are also Weyl groups.  This avoids a clash of notation with the \hyperref[group.alternating]{alternating group} $A_n$, the dihedral group $D_n$, and the \hyperref[group.frobenius]{Frobenius group} $F_n$.
