\begin{definition*}\label{group.dihedral}
\uses{group.dicyclic,group.order}
The \textbf{dihedral group} is the set of symmetries of a regular $n$-gon under the operation of composition.  It consists of $n$ rotations and $n$ reflections, has \hyperref[group.order]{order} $2n$, and can be generated by one rotation of order $n$ and one reflection of order $2$.
$$D_n = \langle g,h \mid g^n=h^2=1, hg=g^{-1}h \rangle = \{e,g,g_2,...,g_{n-1},h,gh,...,g_{n-1}h\}.$$
It is the split extension $C_n\rtimes C_2$ with $C_2$ acting by $-1$. The non-split extension in this case is the \hyperref[group.dicyclic]{dicyclic}  group.
