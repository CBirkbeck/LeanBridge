\begin{definition}\label{group}
\uses{alg.binary_operation,alg.binary_operation.associative,alg.binary_operation.identity,alg.binary_operation.inverse}
A **group** $\langle G, *\rangle$ is a set $G$ with a {{KNOWL('alg.binary_operation', 'binary operation')}} $*$ such that

1. $*$ is {{KNOWL('alg.binary_operation.associative', 'associative')}}
2. $*$ has an {{KNOWL('alg.binary_operation.identity', 'identity element')}}
3. every element $g\in G$ has an {{KNOWL('alg.binary_operation.inverse', 'inverse')}}.
