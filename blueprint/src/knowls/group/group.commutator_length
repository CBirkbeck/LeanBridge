\begin{definition*}\label{group.commutator_length}
\uses{group.commutator_subgroup}
The \hyperref[group.commutator_subgroup]{commutator subgroup} is generated by commutators, but it's not necessarily the case that every element is a commutator.  The \textbf{commutator length} of $G$ is the minimal integer $k$ so that every element of $G'$ can be written as the product of $k$ commutators.
