\subsection{Commutator length}
\begin{definition}\label{group.commutator_length}
\uses{group.commutator_subgroup}
The {{KNOWL('group.commutator_subgroup', 'commutator subgroup')}} is generated by commutators, but it's not necessarily the case that every element is a commutator.  The **commutator length** of $G$ is the minimal integer $k$ so that every element of $G'$ can be written as the product of $k$ commutators.
\end{definition}
