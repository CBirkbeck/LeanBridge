Suppose $H$ and $N$ are \hyperref[group]{groups} with operations $*_H$ and $*_N$ and $\phi:H\to \Aut(N)$ is a \hyperref[group.homomorphism]{homomorphism} to the \hyperref[group.automorphism]{automorphism} group of $N$. Then the set $N\times H$ with the operation
\[ (n_1, h_1)*(n_2, h_2) = (n_1*_N \phi(h_1)(n_2),  h_1 *_H h_2)\]
is a group called a \textbf{semidirect product} of $H$ and $N$ denoted $N:H$ or $N\rtimes H$.  If $\phi$ is the trivial homomorphism, then the resulting group is the \hyperref[group.direct_product]{direct product} $N\times H$, so it is a \textbf{trivial semidirect product}.

The group $N:H$ has subgroups
\[ N' = \{(n,e)\mid n\in N\} \cong N\]
and
\[ H' = \{(e,h) \mid h\in H\} \cong H\]
satisfying $N'\cap H'=\{(e,e)\}$, $N'H'=N:H$, and $N'$ is a \hyperref[group.subgroup.normal]{normal} \hyperref[group.subgroup]{subgroup} of $N:H$.

Conversely, if a group $G$ has a normal subgroup $N$ and a subgroup $H$ such that $N\cap H=\{e\}$ such that $N\cap H=\{e\}$ and $NH=G$, then $G\cong N:H$ for some function $\phi$.  We call $N$ a \textbf{semidirect factor} of $G$ in this case.

The semidirect product of $N$ and $H$ fits into a sequence
\[ 1 \to N \to N \rtimes H \to H \to 1, \]
and is distinguished by the existence of a homomorphism $H \to N \rtimes H$ with image $H'$ that splits the projection $N \rtimes H \to H$.  We refer to such an \hyperref[group.nonsplit_product]{extension} as \textbf{split}, in contrast to other  \textbf{non-split} extensions.
