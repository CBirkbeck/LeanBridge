\begin{definition}\label{group.perfect}
\uses{group,group.commutator_subgroup}
A \hyperref[group]{group} $G$ is \textbf{perfect} if it is equal to its own \hyperref[group.commutator_subgroup]{commutator subgroup} $G'$. Equivalently, $G$ has no non-trivial cyclic (equivalently abelian, equivalently soluble) quotients. All non-abelian simple and quasisimple groups are perfect.

A perfect group may have cyclic composition factors, for example, $\mathrm{SL}(2,5)=C_2.A_5$ is perfect.
