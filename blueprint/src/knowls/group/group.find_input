\begin{definition}\label{group.find_input}
\uses{group.families,group.label}
To find a specific abstract group or subgroup, enter its \hyperref[group.label]{label}.

You can also specify a group that occurs in a family by entering its name. For instance, the cyclic group $C_6$ of order $6$ can be specified by `C6`, and $\GL(2,3)$ by `GL(2,3)`. The currently supported families are listed \hyperref[group.families]{here}.

Finally, you can give the output of Magma's `GroupName` command, such as `C3:C4` (which uniquely specifies a group) or `C16.D4` (which is the name of two non-isomorphic groups).  Direct products are indicated by `*`, semidirect products by `:` and nonsplit products by `.`.  Note that order is important and must match the string generated by Magma: `C2*A5` will succeed but `A5*C2` will not.
