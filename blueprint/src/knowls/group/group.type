For a finite \hyperref[group]{group} $G$, we write \textbf{Type - length} as follows

<ul>
<li> If $G$ is \hyperref[group.cyclic]{cyclic} we write "Cyclic".  For \hyperref[group.abelian]{abelian} groups that are not cyclic we write "Abelian - $n$", where $n$ is the number of cyclic groups in the unique cyclic decomposition of $G$ as $C_{d_1} \times C_{d_2}\times \cdots \times C_{d_n}$ with $d_i\mid d_{i+1}$ and $d_i>0$.</li>

<li> If $G$ is \hyperref[group.nilpotent]{nilpotent} but not abelian then we write  "Nilpotent - $n$", where $n$ is the nilpotency class of $G$.</li>

<li> If $G$ is \hyperref[group.solvable]{solvable} but not nilpotent then we write  "Solvable - $n$", where $n$ is the \hyperref[group.derived_series]{derived length} of $G$.</li>

<li> If $G$ is simple we write "Simple".  

 <li> For non-simple, non-solvable groups we write "Non-solvable - $n$", where $n$ is the number of Jordan factors of $G$.</li>
</ul>
