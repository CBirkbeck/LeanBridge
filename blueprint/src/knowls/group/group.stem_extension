\begin{definition}\label{group.stem_extension}
\uses{group.center,group.commutator_subgroup,group.isoclinism,group.perfect,group.schur_multiplier}
A short exact sequence of groups
$$
1 \to K \to C \to G \to 1
$$
is a \textbf{stem extension} if $K$ is contained in both the \hyperref[group.center]{center} and the \hyperref[group.commutator_subgroup]{commutator} of $G$ (we also refer to $K$ as a \textbf{stem subgroup} of $C$).  For fixed $G$, the size of $C$ is bounded.  For any extension with $C$ of maximal size, the kernel $K$ is isomorphic to the \hyperref[group.schur_multiplier]{Schur multiplier} of $G$.  In general, $C$ is only determined up to \hyperref[group.isoclinism]{isoclinism} in such an extension, but if $G$ is \hyperref[group.perfect]{perfect} then $C$ is determined up to isomorphism.
