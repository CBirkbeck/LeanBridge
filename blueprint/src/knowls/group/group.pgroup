\begin{definition*}\label{group.pgroup}
\uses{group,group.order}
A \textbf{$p$-group} is a \hyperref[group]{group} whose \hyperref[group.order]{order} is a power of a prime $p$.  A result of Higman and Sims shows that the number of groups of order $p^k$ is $p^{(2/27 + o(1))k^3}$, and this can be combined with a result of Pyber to show that, asymptotically, 100% of groups are $p$-groups.
