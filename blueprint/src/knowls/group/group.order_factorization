\begin{definition*}\label{group.order_factorization}
\uses{group.order}
You can provide the exponents for the factorization of the \hyperref[group.order]{order} of the group into primes.  Enter them in descending order, not the order matching the primes.  So, for example, $18$ would be entered as [2, 1].
