\subsection{Isogeny of abelian varieties}
\begin{definition}\label{av.isogeny}
\uses{ag.abelian_variety,av.isogeny_class}
An **isogeny** of {{KNOWL("ag.abelian_variety", "abelian varieties")}} is a surjective algebraic group homomorphism with finite kernel.

Two abelian varieties are **isogenous** if there is an isogeny between them. This defines an equivalence relation on the set of isomorphism classes.  Equivalence classes are called {{KNOWL("av.isogeny_class", "isogeny classes")}}.
\end{definition}
