\subsection{Projective image type}
\begin{definition}\label{artin.projective_image_type}
\uses{artin,artin.projective_image,group.subgroup}
The {{KNOWL('artin.projective_image', 'projective image')}} of an {{KNOWL('artin', 'Artin representation')}} is a finite {{KNOWL('group.subgroup', 'subgroup')}} of $\PGL_n(\C)$.  Possible subgroups have been classified for small $n$.  The case which has garnered the most interest is when $n=2$, in which case the image is isomorphic to either $A_4$, $S_4$, $A_5$, or $D_n$ for some $n\geq 2$ (where $D_2$ is the Klein group).
