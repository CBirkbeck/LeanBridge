\subsection{Conjugate stable order}
\begin{definition}\label{av.fq.conjugate_stable}
\uses{}
The Ã©tale algebra $K=\Q[F]$ generated by the Frobenius endomorphism of an abelian variety over $\F_q$ comes equipped with an algebra involution  induced by $F\mapsto V=q/F$.
This is the **CM-involution** of $K$ and it is denoted by $\overline{\cdot}$.
An order $R$ in $K$ is **conjugate stable** if $R = \overline{R}$.
\end{definition}
