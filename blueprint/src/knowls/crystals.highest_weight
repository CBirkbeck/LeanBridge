\subsection{Highest weight crystals}
\begin{definition}\label{crystals.highest_weight}
\uses{crystals.crystal}
Highest weight crystals are {{ KNOWL('crystals.crystal') }} which have a highest weight element. A highest weight element $b$ is annihilated by all Kashiwara raising operators:
\[
e_i b = 0 \quad \text{for all } i\in I.
\]
The weight of the highest weight element is used to label the crystal.
