\begin{definition*}\label{cmf.dimension}
\uses{cmf.galois_orbit,cmf.newform,cmf.newform_subspace}
The \textbf{dimension} of a space of modular forms is its dimension as a complex vector space; for spaces of newforms $S_k^{\rm new}(N,\chi)$ this is the same as the dimension of the $\Q$-vector space spanned by its eigenforms.

The \textbf{dimension} of a \hyperref[cmf.newform]{newform} refers to the dimension of its \hyperref[cmf.newform_subspace]{newform subspace}, equivalently, the cardinality of its \hyperref[cmf.galois_orbit]{newform orbit}.  This is equal to the degree of its coefficient field (as an extension of $\Q$).

The \textbf{relative dimension} of $S_k^{\rm new}(N,\chi)$  is its dimension as a $\Q(\chi)$-vector space, where $\Q(\chi)$ is the field generated by the values of $\chi$, and similarly for newform subspaces.
