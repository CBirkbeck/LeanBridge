\begin{definition*}\label{cmf.coefficient_ring}
\uses{cmf.coefficient_field,cmf.newform}
The \textbf{coefficient ring } of a modular form is the subring $\Z[a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots]$ of $\C$ generated by the coefficients $a_n$ of its $q$-expansion $\sum a_nq^n$.  In the case of a \hyperref[cmf.newform]{newform} the coefficients $a_n$ are algebraic integers and the coefficient ring is a finite index subring of the ring of integers of the \hyperref[cmf.coefficient_field]{coefficient field} of the newform.
It is also known as the \textbf{Hecke ring}, since the $a_n$ are eigenvalues of Hecke operators.
