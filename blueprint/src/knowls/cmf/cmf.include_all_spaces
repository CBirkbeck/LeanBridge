\begin{definition}\label{cmf.include_all_spaces}
\uses{cmf.newform,cmf.newspaces}
By default (the "split" option), only \hyperref[cmf.newspaces]{newspaces} with known decomposition into \hyperref[cmf.newform]{newforms} are included in search results.  If you want to include spaces with large conductor where this decomposition has not been computed, choose the "all" option.

\end{definition}
