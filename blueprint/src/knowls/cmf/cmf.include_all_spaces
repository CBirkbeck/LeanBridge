\subsection{Include all spaces}
\begin{definition}\label{cmf.include_all_spaces}
\uses{cmf.newform,cmf.newspaces}
By default (the "split" option), only {{ KNOWL('cmf.newspaces', 'newspaces') }} with known decomposition into {{ KNOWL('cmf.newform', 'newforms') }} are included in search results.  If you want to include spaces with large conductor where this decomposition has not been computed, choose the "all" option.

\end{definition}
