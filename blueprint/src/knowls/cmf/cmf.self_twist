\begin{definition}\label{cmf.self_twist}
\uses{character.dirichlet,character.dirichlet.order,character.dirichlet.primitive,cmf.level,cmf.newform,cmf.projective_image,cmf.weight,nf.discriminant}
A \hyperref[cmf.newform]{newform} $f$ admits a \textbf{self-twist} by a \hyperref[character.dirichlet.primitive]{primitive}
 \hyperref[character.dirichlet]{Dirichlet character} $\chi$ if the equality
\[
a_p(f) = \chi(p)a_p(f)
\]
holds for all but finitely many primes $p$.

For non-trivial $\chi$ this can hold only when $\chi$ has \hyperref[character.dirichlet.order]{order} $2$ and $a_p=0$ for all primes $p$ not dividing the \hyperref[cmf.level]{level} of $f$ for which $\chi(p)=-1$.
The character $\chi$ is then the Kronecker character of a quadratic field $K$ and may be identified by the \hyperref[nf.discriminant]{discriminant} $D$ of $K$.

If $D$ is negative, the modular form $f$ is said to have \hyperref[cmf.cm_form]{complex multiplication} (CM) by $K$, and if $D$ is positive, $f$ is said to have \hyperref[cmf.rm_form]{real multiplication} (RM) by $K$.  The latter can occur only when $f$ is a modular form of \hyperref[cmf.weight]{weight} $1$ whose \hyperref[cmf.projective_image]{projective image} is dihedral.

It is possible for a modular form to have multiple non-trivial self twists; this occurs precisely when $f$ is a modular form of weight one whose projective image is isomorphic to $D_2:=C_2\times C_2$; in this case $f$ admits three non-trivial self twists, two of which are CM and one of which is RM.
