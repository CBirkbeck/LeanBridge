\begin{definition}\label{cmf.coefficient_field}
\uses{cmf.cusp_form,cmf.fouriercoefficients,cmf.hecke_operator}
The \textbf{coefficient field} of a modular form is the subfield of $\C$ generated by the coefficients $a_n$ of its $q$-expansion $\sum a_nq^n$.  The space of \hyperref[cmf.cusp_form]{cusp forms} $S_k^\mathrm{new}(N,\chi)$ has a basis of modular forms that are simultaneous eigenforms for all \hyperref[cmf.hecke_operator]{Hecke operators} and with algebraic \hyperref[cmf.fouriercoefficients]{Fourier coefficients}.  For such eigenforms the coefficient field will be a number field, and Galois conjugate eigenforms will share the same coefficient field.  Moreover, if $m$ is the smallest positive integer such that the values of the character $\chi$ are contained in the cyclotomic field $\Q(\zeta_m)$, the coefficient field will contain $\Q(\zeta_m)$
For eigenforms, the coefficient field is also known as the \textbf{Hecke field}.
