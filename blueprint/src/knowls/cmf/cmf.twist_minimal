\begin{definition}\label{cmf.twist_minimal}
\uses{character.dirichlet.minimal,cmf.character,cmf.galois_orbit,cmf.label,cmf.level,cmf.newform,cmf.twist}
A \hyperref[cmf.newform]{newform} $f$ is \textbf{twist minimal} if its \hyperref[cmf.level]{level} achieves the minimum within its \hyperref[cmf.twist]{twist class}.

A twist minimal newform $f$ need not have \hyperref[character.dirichlet.minimal]{minimal character}, but if this is not the case there will be a twist of $f$ that is both twist minimal and has minimal \hyperref[cmf.character]{character}.

In the LMFDB, the designated representative of each twist class is the twist minimal newform $g$ of minimal character whose \hyperref[cmf.label]{label} is lexicographically minimal among all such newforms.  This newform $g$ is called the \textbf{minimal twist} of the newforms in its twist equivalence class and is identified by a checkmark (\checkmark) in tables of twists.

These conventions also apply to \hyperref[cmf.galois_orbit]{newform orbits}.
