\begin{definition}\label{cmf.trace_form}
\uses{cmf.coefficient_field,cmf.dimension,cmf.newform,cmf.newspace}
For a \hyperref[cmf.newform]{newform} $f \in S_k^{\rm new}(\Gamma_1(N))$, its \textbf{trace form} $\mathrm{Tr}(f)$ is the sum of its distinct conjugates under $\mathrm{Aut}(\C)$ (equivalently, the sum under all embeddings of the \hyperref[cmf.coefficient_field]{coefficient field} into $\C$).  The trace form is a modular form $\mathrm{Tr}(f) \in S_k^{\rm new}(\Gamma_1(N))$ whose $q$-expansion has integral coefficients $a_n(\mathrm{Tr}(f)) \in \Z$.

The coefficient $a_1$ is equal to the \hyperref[cmf.dimension]{dimension} of the newform.

For $p$ prime, the coefficient $a_p$ is the trace of Frobenius in the direct sum of the $\ell$-adic Galois representations attached to the conjugates of $f$ (for any prime $\ell$).  When $f$ has weight $k=2$, the coefficient $a_p(f)$ is the trace of Frobenius acting on the modular abelian variety associated to $f$.

For a \hyperref[cmf.newspace]{newspace} $S_k^{\rm new}(N,\chi)$, its trace form is the sum of the trace forms $\mathrm{Tr}(f)$ over all newforms $f\in S_k^{\rm new}(N,k)$; it is also a modular form in $S_k^{\rm new}(\Gamma_1(N))$.

The graphical plot displayed in the properties box on the home page of each newform or newspace is computed using the trace form.
