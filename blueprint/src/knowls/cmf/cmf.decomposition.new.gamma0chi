\begin{definition}\label{cmf.decomposition.new.gamma0chi}
\uses{cmf.hecke_operator,cmf.newform}
The \hyperref[cmf.hecke_operator]{Hecke algebra} acts on \(S_k^{\mathrm{new}}(N, \chi)\), breaking it up into irreducible pieces.  Each piece is spanned by a set of conjugate eigenforms with Fourier coefficients in a number field of degree equal to the dimension of the subspace.  We refer to an irreducible orbit as a \textbf{\hyperref[cmf.newform]{newform}}.
\end{definition}
