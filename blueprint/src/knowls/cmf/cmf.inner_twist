\subsection{Inner twist}
\begin{definition}\label{cmf.inner_twist}
\uses{character.dirichlet,character.dirichlet.galois_orbit,character.dirichlet.primitive,cmf.cm_form,cmf.coefficient_field,cmf.galois_conjugate,cmf.galois_orbit,cmf.newform,cmf.rm_form,cmf.self_twist}
{{KNOWL('cmf.galois_conjugate', 'Galois conjugate')}} {{KNOWL('cmf.newform', 'newforms')}} $f$ and $g$ are **inner twists** if there is a {{KNOWL('character.dirichlet', 'Dirichlet character')}} $\chi$ such that
\[
a_p(g) = \chi(p)a_p(f)
\]
for all but finitely many primes $p$.  Without loss of generality, we may assume that $\chi$ is a {{KNOWL('character.dirichlet.primitive', 'primitive')}} Dirichlet character, and by a theorem of Ribet \cite{mr:0594532,doi:10.1007/BF01457819}, the newform $g$ is conjugate to $f$ via a $\Q$-automorphism $\sigma$ of the {{KNOWL('cmf.coefficient_field', 'coefficient field')}} of $f$.  The set of pairs $(\chi,\sigma)$ form the {{KNOWL('cmf.inner_twist_group', 'group of inner twists')}} of $f$.

Each pair $(\chi,\sigma)$ corresponding to an inner twist of $f$ is uniquely determined by the the primitive character $\chi$, and we say that $f$ admits an inner twist by $\chi$.  When $\sigma=1$ is is the trivial automorphism, we have $g=f$ and say that $f$ admits a {{KNOWL('cmf.self_twist', 'self twist')}} by $\chi$; in this case $\chi$ is either the trivial character or the Kronecker character of a quadratic field. 

The {{KNOWL('cmf.inner_twist_count', 'number')}} of inner twists of $f$ is an invariant of its {{KNOWL('cmf.galois_orbit', 'Galois orbit')}}, as is the number of inner twists by characters in any particular {{KNOWL('character.dirichlet.galois_orbit', 'Galois orbit of Dirichlet characters')}}.

The home page of each newform in the LMFDB includes a list of inner twists, in which non-trivial self twists are distinguished by listing the associated quadratic field (the {{KNOWL('cmf.cm_form', 'CM')}} or {{KNOWL('cmf.rm_form', 'RM')}} field), while inner twists that are not self twists are simply marked as "inner".
