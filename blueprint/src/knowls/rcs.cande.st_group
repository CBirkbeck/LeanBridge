\subsection{Completeness of Sato-Tate Group Data}
\begin{definition}\label{rcs.cande.st_group}
\uses{st_group.definition,st_group.degree,st_group.rational,st_group.weight}
The database currently contains all {{KNOWL('st_group.rational', "rational")}} {{KNOWL('st_group.definition', "Sato-Tate groups")}} of {{KNOWL('st_group.weight', "weight")}} 1 and {{KNOWL('st_group.degree', "degree")}} up to 6, as well as the two rational Sato-Tate groups of weight 0 and degree 1. Pages for irrational Sato-Tate groups of weight 0 and degree 1 are available for component groups of order up to $10^{20}$, but only those order up to $10^{4}$ are shown in search results.
