\subsection{Hecke algebra}
\begin{definition}\label{hecke_algebra.definition}
\uses{cmf.hecke_operator,mf,mf.modular symbols}
For a commutative ring $R$ and an $R$-module $M$ equipped with an action of {{ KNOWL('cmf.hecke_operator', "Hecke operators")}}, such as spaces of {{ KNOWL("mf", "modular forms")}} or {{ KNOWL("mf.modular symbols", "modular symbols")}}, the associated $R$-Hecke algebra is the $R$-subalgebra of the $R$-endomorphism ring of $M$ generated by the Hecke operators.

We usually include all {{ KNOWL('cmf.hecke_operator', "Hecke operators")}}, i.e. also those the index of which divides the level or is a multiple of the characteristic (if applicable). 

If the ring $R$ is not mentioned, then it is either $\Q$ or $\C$, depending on the context.
