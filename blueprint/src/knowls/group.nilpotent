\subsection{Nilpotent group}
\begin{definition}\label{group.nilpotent}
\uses{group,group.abelian,group.monomial,group.solvable,group.supersolvable}
A finite {{KNOWL('group', 'group')}} $G$ is **nilpotent** if it is a direct product of $p$-groups. Equivalently, all Sylow subgroups of $G$ are normal. Equivalently, $G$ has a central series
\[\{1\}=G_0 \lhd G_1 \lhd G_2 \lhd \ldots \lhd G_k = G,\]
a nested sequence of normal subgroups with $[G,G_{i+1}] \leq G_i$. 

The smallest such $k$ is the **nilpotency class** of $G$. It is $0$ for $C_1$, $1$ for non-trivial {{KNOWL('group.abelian', 'abelian')}} groups, and $\geq 2$ for all other nilpotent groups. By convention, one can define the nilpotency class of a non-nilpotent group to be $-1$.

Nilpotent groups are closed under subgroups and quotients (but not extensions), and are {{ KNOWL("group.solvable", "solvable")}}, {{ KNOWL("group.supersolvable", "supersolvable")}} and {{ KNOWL("group.monomial", "monomial")}}.
