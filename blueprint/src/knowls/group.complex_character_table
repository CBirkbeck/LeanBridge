\subsection{Complex character table of a finite group}
\begin{definition}\label{group.complex_character_table}
\uses{group,group.label_complex_group_char,group.label_conjugacy_class,group.representation.character}
The **complex character table** of a finite {{KNOWL('group', 'group')}} $G$ is a square tabulation of the value of its irreducible {{KNOWL('group.representation.character', 'complex characters')}}, which encodes useful information about the group $G$ in a compact way. Each row of the table is labeled by an irreducible character (given by its  {{KNOWL('group.label_complex_group_char','label')}}) and the entries in the row are the values of that character on some representative of the corresponding conjugacy class of $G$ given by its {{KNOWL('group.label_conjugacy_class','label')}} on the columns.
\end{definition}
