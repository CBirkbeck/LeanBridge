\subsection{Hurwitz bound}
\begin{definition}\label{curve.highergenus.hurwitz_bound}
\uses{curve.highergenus.aut.3.168-42.0.2-3-7.top,curve.highergenus.aut.7.504-156.0.2-3-7.top}
For any integer $g > 1$, the automorphism group of any curve of genus $g$ over $\C$ has order at most $84(g-1)$. This is not best possible for every $g$, but there do exist infinitely many $g$ for which the bound is achieved; examples include {{ KNOWL('curve.highergenus.aut.3.168-42.0.2-3-7.top') }} ($g=3$) and the {{ KNOWL('curve.highergenus.aut.7.504-156.0.2-3-7.top') }} ($g=7$).
