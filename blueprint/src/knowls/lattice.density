\subsection{Density of an integral lattice}
\begin{definition}\label{lattice.density}
\uses{lattice.definition,lattice.dimension}
The **density** of an $n\times n$ {{ KNOWL("lattice.definition", "integral lattice")}} is  the density of the lattice-centered sphere packing in $\mathbb R^n$. 

The **lattice packing problem** of {{ KNOWL('lattice.dimension','dimension') }} $n$ is to find the lattices which maximize the density. In general, these may not be solutions of the **sphere packing problem**, which asks for the maximum density of a sphere packing in which the centers of the spheres need not form an integral lattice.
\end{definition}
