In the LMFDB, we aim for every object to have its own homepage.  Note
the following features:

\textbf{Knowls:}  Interspersed throughout the LMFDB are underlined words.
These words represent knowls, which are bits of context free
information.  A knowl is identified by a word or phrase underlined
with a dotted line.  Clicking on a \hyperref[doc.knowl]{knowl} brings up a box of text containing information about the object.
Clicking on the knowl a second time will retract the box of text.

\textbf{Navigating:}

\begin{itemize}
\item  *\textbf{Browsing:}* One way to investigate information on the database is
\end{itemize}
through browsing.  For each type of object in the database, you can
browse by distinguishing features.  For example, to look for
information about L-functions, you can browse by \hyperref[lfunction.degree]{degree} or \hyperref[lfunction.underlying_object]{underlying object}.

\begin{itemize}
\item  *\textbf{Searching:}*  Another way to investigate is through searching.  You
\end{itemize}
can search either by using a label to find a specific object or by
specifying certain characteristics an object may have.  For each of
these types of searching, there is an example in grey text, and a
description of possible inputs.  Some fields may be left blank (or
with grey text) in a search.

\begin{itemize}
\item  *\textbf{Navigation Bars:}* On a given page, additional headings may appear in
\end{itemize}
the navigation bar.  For example Learn More About, which contains additional
information, and Downloads or Data, for files.

\begin{itemize}
\item  *\textbf{Breadcrumbs:}*  On the top left of the header of a given page there is
\end{itemize}
a description of your current path of navigation.  Clicking on an item
in the path will take you back to that page.

\textbf{Properties:}  On the upper right hand side of a homepage for an object
there is often a box containing specific properties of the object.
This box can be closed and opened by clicking on the vertical arrow.

\textbf{Related Objects:}  Often below the properties box in the upper right hand side of a homepage for an object is a box containing links to the homepages of directly related objects.

\textbf{Zeros of L-functions Search:}  For each L-function in the database we
have identified the lowest \hyperref[lfunction.zeros]{zero} above the real axis.  It is believed
that the value of this zero uniquely identifies an L-function.  This
gives an interesting and useful way of identifying an L-function.

\textbf{Downloading:}  You may download available data, for example moment polynomials of the zeta function.  Some data is available to download within a page, while other data may be obtained through a link in the navigation bar. 

\textbf{Feedback:}  If you encounter any issues or problems while using the LMFDB, please click on Feedback in the upper right hand corner of the header to file a report.
