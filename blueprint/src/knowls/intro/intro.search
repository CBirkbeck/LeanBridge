\begin{itemize}
\item  The objects returned will satisfy all of the constraints that you enter.
\item  Within a single text field, you can use commas to get a union of a set of desired inputs.
\item  You can indicate a range by using either a hyphen or a .., such as "3-9" or "3..9".
\item  You can negate a query by inserting a "~" at the beginning; for example "~3,5" excludes objects for which the relevant attribute has value 3 or 5.
