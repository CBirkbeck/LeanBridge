The simplest of all \hyperref[lfunction]{L-functions} is the \hyperref[lfunction.riemann]{Riemann zeta function}, a
function whose analytic properties were first discovered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard\_Riemann">Bernhard Riemann</a> in
1859 in his attempts to find a formula for the number of primes
smaller than a given number $x$. It gives us a model for how to think
about other L-functions.

Let's begin by  taking a look at this prototype:
<a href="/L/Riemann/" target="\_blank">the Riemann zeta function homepage</a>.

The first thing we see is that the Riemann zeta function can be
defined as a special type of infinite series, called a \hyperref[lfunction.dirichlet_series]{Dirichlet
series}:

$\zeta(s):=1+\frac1{2^s}+\frac1{3^s}+\frac1{4^s}+\cdots.$

This is the classical definition of $\zeta(s)$ and holds in the half
plane $Re(s)>1$.

All L-functions can be expressed as Dirichlet series. On this website
we \hyperref[lfunction.normalization]{normalize} each Dirichlet series so
that it converges absolutely for  $ Re (s)>1$.

The page then exhibits the \hyperref[lfunction.functional_equation]{functional equation}, an equation that
relates the values of this L-function on the left and on the right of
the line $ Re (s)= 1/2$. A key component of the functional equation is that it
involves \hyperref[specialfunction.gamma]{Euler's Gamma function}, which is well known as a function
that interpolates factorials.
Again, this is typical of all L-functions: there is a functional
equation involving the product of the L-function and some
Gamma functions and relates the values at $s$ and $1-s$.  The \hyperref[lfunction.selbergdata]{Selberg data} is a way of encoding the functional equation; details at the bottom of this page.

The page then goes on by showing the \hyperref[lfunction.euler_product]{Euler product} formula of the
L-function. In the case of $\zeta(s)$, this was discovered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard\_Euler">Leonhard Euler</a>
and later used by Riemann as a starting point for investigating
prime numbers. In particular, Riemann showed that the distribution of
prime numbers is determined by the location of the \hyperref[lfunction.zeros]{zeros} of
$\zeta(s)$.  All L-functions have an Euler product, i.e. they have an
expression as an infinite product over primes where the factor for
each prime is the inverse of a polynomial in $ p^{-s} $.

Next we find the imaginary parts of the first few zeros of the Riemann
zeta function.
Riemann's Hypothesis is that any \hyperref[lfunction.trivial_zero]{non-trivial zero} of the zeta function
has real part 1/2.  Moreover, it's hypothesized that any non-trivial zero of any L-function has real part 1/2.  This is true, so far, for
every zero ever found. Consequently on these pages we only display the
imaginary parts of the zeros. The first non-trivial zero of the
Riemann zeta function
is at $ 1/2+ i 14.1347... $ and was actually computed by Riemann himself.
It has been checked that the first 10 trillion zeros of the Riemann zeta
function all have real part 1/2, where the zeros are written in increasing
order of their imaginary part.
On these pages we have high precision rendering of the first 36
billion zeros; see [http://www.lmfdb.org/zeros/zeta/](http://www.lmfdb.org/zeros/zeta/).

Further information found on the Riemann zeta function page is the
list of values the function takes at some special points.  Again, this
is typical of L-functions. The special values of L-functions form a
remarkable area of modern research. The \hyperref[ec.q.bsdconjecture]{Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer
Conjecture}, mentioned
above as one of the Clay Millennium problems, has to do with the
special values of L-functions
associated with \hyperref[ec.q]{elliptic curves}.

Finally the page concludes by displaying the graph of the \hyperref[lfunction.zfunction]{Hardy
Z-function}. This function has the same modulus as $\zeta(s)$ on the \hyperref[lfunction.critical_line]{critical line}, so its graph helps to provide a visual picture of the Riemann
zeta function. In particular, the Z-function has the same zeros as the
L-function and so for this one we can see the first zero at 14.1347...

In order to successfully navigate the L-functions pages you need to
know a little bit about how we classify L-functions. As we mentioned,
each L-function has a Dirichlet series, a functional equation, and an
Euler product.
We sort our L-functions first by \hyperref[lfunction.degree]{degree}, then by \hyperref[lfunction.conductor]{conductor}.

There is a certain amount of compatibility between these expressions.
For example, it is believed that the Euler product can always be
written as a product over  primes
of the inverse of a  polynomial in $p^{-s}$. In all known cases, at almost all
primes the
degree of this polynomial is the same as the number of
\hyperref[lfunction.gamma_factor]{Gamma factors} in the functional equation!

We specify a functional equation  by providing its \hyperref[lfunction.selbergdata]{Selberg data};
this is a 4-tuple which has the shape 
(\hyperref[lfunction.degree]{degree}, 
\hyperref[lfunction.conductor]{conductor}, \hyperref[lfunction.spectral_parameters]{Gamma-shifts}, 
\hyperref[lfunction.root_number]{sign}),
or:

$ (d,N,(\mu_1,\dots , \mu_{J}:\nu_{1},\dots ,\nu_{K}),\varepsilon). $

Here the degree $d=J+2K$ is a positive integer, the \hyperref[lfunction.conductor]{conductor} $N$ is a
positive integer, the $ \mu $ are complex numbers with non-negative real parts and
imaginary parts which sum to 0, and the sign $ \epsilon $ is a
complex number with absolute value $1$.  

For example, the LMFDB page for the Riemann zeta function identifies
its Selberg data using the notation $(1,1,(0:),1)$, where the first value $1$ is the
\hyperref[lfunction.degree]{degree}, the second is the \hyperref[lfunction.conductor]{conductor}, $(0:)$ indicates the \hyperref[lfunction.spectral_parameters]{spectral
parameters} and the last $1$ is the \hyperref[lfunction.sign]{sign} of the functional equation.
