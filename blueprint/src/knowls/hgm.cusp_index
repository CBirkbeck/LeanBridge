\subsection{Cusp index}
\begin{definition}\label{hgm.cusp_index}
\uses{}
A **cusp-index** of degree $d$ is a weakly increasing
list of positive integers $[u_1,\dots,u_k]$ with $\sum_{i=1}^k \phi(u_i) = d$.

Hypergeometric families $H(A,B)$ are indexed by pairs
$(A,B)$ of cusp-indices of a common degree having no common entries.
