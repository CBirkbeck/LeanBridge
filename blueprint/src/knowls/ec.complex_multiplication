\subsection{Complex multiplication}

\uses{ag.complex_multiplication,ec,ec.endomorphism_ring,ec.geom_endomorphism_ring,ec.j_invariant,nf.class_number,nf.order,ring.characteristic}
An {{KNOWL('ec', 'elliptic curve')}} whose {{ KNOWL('ec.endomorphism_ring', "endomorphism ring") }} is larger than \(\Z\) is said to have **complex multiplication** (often abbreviated to CM).  In this case, for curves defined over fields of {{KNOWL('ring.characteristic', 'characteristic')}} zero, the endomorphism ring is isomorphic to an {{KNOWL('nf.order', 'order')}} in an imaginary quadratic field.  The discriminant of this order is the **CM discriminant**.

An elliptic curve whose {{ KNOWL('ec.geom_endomorphism_ring', "geometric endomorphism ring") }} is larger than \(\Z\) is said to have **potential complex multiplication** (potential CM).  In the literature, these too are often called CM elliptic curves.

The property of having potential CM depends only on the {{ KNOWL('ec.j_invariant', '$j$-invariant') }} of the curve.  In characteristic $0$, CM $j$-invariants are algebraic integers, and there are only finitely many in any given number field.  There are precisely 13 CM $j$-invariants in $\Q$ (all integers), associated to the 13 imaginary quadratic orders of {{KNOWL('nf.class_number', 'class number')}} $1$:

CM elliptic curves are examples of {{KNOWL('ag.complex_multiplication', "CM abelian varieties")}}.
