\begin{definition}\label{alg.binary_operation.identity}
\uses{alg.binary_operation}
If $*$ is a \hyperref[alg.binary_operation]{binary operation} on a set $A$, then $A$ has an \textbf{identity} element with respect to $*$ if there exists $e\in A$ such that for all $a\in A$,
$$ a*e = e*a = a.$$
Such an identity element $e$, if it exists, is unique and is thus called \textbf{the identity element} of $A$ with respect to $*$.
\end{definition}
