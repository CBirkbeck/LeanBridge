\subsection{Maximal image}
\begin{definition}\label{g2c.maximal_galois_rep}
\uses{ag.geom_endomorphism_ring,ag.jacobian,g2c.galois_rep}
The image of the {{KNOWL('g2c.galois_rep','mod-$\ell$  Galois representation')}} associated to a genus 2 curve is **maximal** if it is as large as possible given constraints imposed by the Weil pairing and endomorphisms of the {{KNOWL('ag.jacobian', 'Jacobian')}}.

For **generic** curves the {{KNOWL('ag.geom_endomorphism_ring', 'geometric endomorphism ring')}} of the Jacobian is $\Z$ and the maximal image is $\GSp(4,\Z/\ell\Z)$. In all other cases it is a proper subgroup of $\GSp(4,\Z/\ell\Z)$.
\end{definition}
