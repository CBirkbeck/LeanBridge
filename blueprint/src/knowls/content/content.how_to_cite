If you would like to acknowledge the LMFDB, please use a citation in the following form, alphabetized under \textit{LMFDB}.

[42] The LMFDB Collaboration, \textit{The L-functions and modular forms database,} 
[<code>https://www.lmfdb.org</code>](http://www.lmfdb.org), <span class="year-today">2023</span>, [Online; accessed <span class="date-today">31 January 2023</span>].

Of course you should change the year and date accessed to match your usage (the same comment applies to all the examples below).
The BibTeX entry is:

 <pre style="padding-left: 1ch;"><code>@misc{lmfdb,
  shorthand    = {LMFDB},
  author       = {The {LMFDB Collaboration}},
  title        = {The {L}-functions and modular forms database},
  howpublished = {\url{https://www.lmfdb.org}},
  year         = {<span class="year-today">2020</span>},
  note         = {[Online; accessed <span class="date-today">31 January 2023</span>]},
}</code></pre>

Then you can cite a certain object much like quoting a specific theorem from a paper. For example, you may refer to the elliptic curve with LMFDB label 11a.2 by

<code>\cite[\href{https://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/Q/11.a2}{Elliptic Curve 11.a2}]{lmfdb}</code>

In order to make the <code>\url</code> and <code>\href</code> commands to work, one should use the [hyperref](http://ctan.org/pkg/hyperref) package.

\end{itemize}

To cite a specific page in the LMFDB, such as the home page of the L-function of the first
rank 4 elliptic curve/$\Q$ shown in the example below, you can cite it as

[42] The LMFDB Collaboration, \textit{The L-functions and modular forms database, 
home page of the L-function $L(s,E)$ for elliptic curve isogeny class $\texttt{234446.a}$},
[https://www.lmfdb.org/L/EllipticCurve/Q/234446.a/](https://www.lmfdb.org/L/EllipticCurve/Q/234446.a/), <span class="year-today">2020</span> , [Online; accessed <span class="date-today">31 July 2020</span>].

The BibTeX entry is:

 <pre style="padding-left: 1ch;"><code>@misc{lmfdb:234446.a,
  shorthand    = {LMFDB E234446.a},
  author       = {The {LMFDB Collaboration}},
  title        = {The {L}-functions and modular forms database, 
     Home page of the L-function $L(s,E)$ for elliptic curve isogeny class \texttt{234446.a}},
  howpublished = {\mbox{\url{https://www.lmfdb.org/L/EllipticCurve/Q/234446.a/}}},
  year         = {<span class="year-today">2020</span>},
  note         = {[Online; accessed <span class="date-today">31 January 2023</span>]},
}</code></pre>
