\begin{definition}\label{group.group_ring}
\uses{group,ring}
If $G$ is a {{KNOWL('group', 'group')}} and $R$ is a {{KNOWL('ring', 'ring')}}, the **group ring** is the free $R$-module with basis $G$ in which multiplication is defined via the distributive law.  It consists of all formal finite sums of the form $\sum r_g g$ with $g\in G$ and $r_g\in R$.
