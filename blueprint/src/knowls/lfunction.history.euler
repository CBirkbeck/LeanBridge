\subsection{Euler's work on the zeta function}
\begin{definition}\label{lfunction.history.euler}

The prototype of L-functions is the Riemann zeta-function defined by
\[
\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac {1}{n^s}
\]
for $\Re s>1$. Euler discovered that $\zeta(2)=\frac{\pi^2}{6}$,
and he also found the fundamental identity
\[
\zeta(s)=\prod_p \left(1-\frac{1}{p^s}\right)^{-1},
\]
which he used to prove that the series $\sum_p \frac{1}{p}$ diverges. Euler considered other divergent series
and noticed a connection between  values of $\zeta$ at $s$ and $1-s$, linked by powers of $\pi$ and {{KNOWL('af.bernoulli_numbers', "Bernoulli numbers")}}, 
such as the interpretations 
$$1+2+3+\dots =-\frac{1}{12}$$
and 
$$1+4+9+16+\dots =0.$$
Euler found hints of many of the remarkable features of L-functions that
make them such worthy objects of study: the Euler product, special values, and the functional equation. 
It was left to Riemann to discover perhaps the most remarkable property of all, one that 
hasn't been proven yet: the Riemann Hypothesis that each  non-real zero of $\zeta(s)$ has real part
equal to $\frac 12 $.
