\begin{definition}\label{shimcurve.order}
\uses{nf.order,shimcurve.quaternion_algebra}
Let $B$ be a \hyperref[shimcurve.quaternion_algebra]{quaternion algebra} over $\Q$. An \textbf{order} $O\subset B$ is a
$\Z$-lattice in $B$ that is also a subring of $B$ (where we 
require $1 \in O$). We say that $O$ is \textbf{maximal} if it is 
not properly contained in another order of $B$.

Unlike \hyperref[nf.order]{orders in number fields}, there 
is never a unique maximal order in a rational quaternion
algebra; however, the number of $B^\times$-conjugacy classes is finite (and in many cases, there is exactly one $B^\times$-conjugacy class).
\end{definition}
