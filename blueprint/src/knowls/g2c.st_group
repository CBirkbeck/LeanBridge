\subsection{Sato-Tate group of a genus 2 curve over Q}
\begin{definition}\label{g2c.st_group}
\uses{ag.jacobian,g2c.g2curve,g2c.st_group_identity_component,st_group.definition}
The **Sato-Tate group** of a curve refers to the Sato-Tate group of its {{KNOWL('ag.jacobian', 'Jacobian')}}, which is a special case of the {{ KNOWL('st_group.definition', 'Sato-Tate group of a motive') }}.

For {{ KNOWL('g2c.g2curve', 'genus 2 curves') }} over $\mathbb{Q}$ there are 6 possibilities for the {{KNOWL('g2c.st_group_identity_component', 'identity component of the Sato-Tate group')}} and 34 possibilities for the full Sato-Tate group; these are labelled according to the classification in Fit√©-Kedlaya-Rotger-Sutherland, _Sato-Tate distributions and Galois endomorphism modules in genus 2_ \cite{arXiv1110.6638,MR2982436,doi:10.1112/S0010437X12000279}. The generic case is $\mathrm{USp}(4)$, which occurs if and only if the Jacobian of the curve has trivial endomorphism ring.
