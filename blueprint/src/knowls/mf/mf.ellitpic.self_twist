\subsection{Self twist of a modular form}
\begin{definition}\label{mf.ellitpic.self_twist}
\uses{character.dirichlet,character.dirichlet.order,character.dirichlet.primitive,cmf.cm_form,cmf.level,cmf.newform,cmf.projective_image,cmf.rm_form,cmf.weight,nf.discriminant}
A {{KNOWL('cmf.newform', 'newform')}} $f=\sum a_n q^n$ admits a **self twist** by a nontrivial {{KNOWL('character.dirichlet.primitive', 'primitive')}} {{KNOWL('character.dirichlet', 'Dirichlet character')}} $\chi$ if we have $a_p=\chi(p)a_p$ for all but finitely many primes $p$.

This can occur only when $\chi$ has {{KNOWL('character.dirichlet.order', 'order')}} $2$ and $a_p=0$ for all primes $p$ not dividing the {{KNOWL('cmf.level', 'level')}} of $f$ for which $\chi(p)=-1$.
The character $\chi$ is then the Kronecker character of a quadratic field $K$ and may be identified by the {{KNOWL('nf.discriminant', 'discriminant')}} $D$ of $K$.

If $D$ is negative, the modular form $f$ is said to have {{KNOWL('cmf.cm_form', 'complex multiplication')}} (CM) by $K$, and if $D$ is positive, $f$ is said to have {{KNOWL('cmf.rm_form', 'real multiplication')}} (RM) by $K$.  The latter can occur only when $f$ is a modular form of {{KNOWL('cmf.weight', 'weight')}} $1$ whose {{KNOWL('cmf.projective_image', 'projective image')}} is dihedral.

It is possible for a modular form to have more than one self twist; this occurs precisely when $f$ is a modular form of weight one whose projective image is isomorphic to $D_2:=C_2\times C_2$; in this case $f$ admits three self twists, two of which are CM and one of which is RM.
