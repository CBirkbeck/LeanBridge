\subsection{Coefficient ring}
\begin{definition}\label{mf.siegel.coefficient_ring}
\uses{mf.siegel.coefficient_field,mf.siegel.newform}
The **coefficient ring ** of a Siegel modular form is the subring $\Z[{a_n}]$ of $\C$ generated by the coefficients $a_n$ of its $q$-expansion $\sum a_nq^n$.  In the case of a {{KNOWL('mf.siegel.newform', 'newform')}} the coefficients $a_n$ are algebraic integers and the coefficient ring is a finite index subring of the ring of integers of the {{KNOWL('mf.siegel.coefficient_field', 'coefficient field')}} of the newform.
It is also known as the **Hecke ring**, since the $a_n$ generate the same ring as the eigenvalues of the Hecke operators.
