\subsection{Pictures for elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$}
\begin{definition}\label{portrait.ec.q}
\uses{ec.q,sage}
For each {{ KNOWL('ec.q', 'elliptic curve') }}  $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, the plot displayed is of part of $E(\mathbb{R})$, the set of real points of $E$.

The plots are produced using {{ KNOWL('sage', 'SageMath') }}, which uses plotting logic designed by David Roe to determine which subset of $E(\mathbb{R})$ in the real affine plane to include in the plot.
\end{definition}
