\subsection{Modular curve $X_0(N)$}
\begin{definition}\label{ag.modcurve.x0}
\uses{ag.curve,ec,ec.isogeny,mf.upper_half_plane}
Let $N \ge 1$. The *modular curve* $X_0(N)$ is an {{KNOWL("ag.curve", "algebraic curve")}} defined over $\Q$ (or even $\Z[1/N]$) whose points over any algebraically closed field of characteristic not dividing $N$ correspond to isomorphism classes of pairs $(E,\phi)$, where $E$ is an {{KNOWL("ec", "elliptic curve")}} and $\phi$ is an {{KNOWL("ec.isogeny", "isogeny")}} with domain $E$ and kernel a cyclic group of order $N$, with the exception of particular points called *cusps* which correspond to degenerate such pairs.

The complex manifold $X_0(N)(\C)$ is biholomorphic to the quotient $\Gamma_0(N) \backslash \mathcal{H}^*$ of the {{KNOWL("mf.upper_half_plane", "completed upper half plane")}}.
